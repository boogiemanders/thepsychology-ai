## Why Brief Therapies Matter for Your Practice

Not every client needs years on the couch. Sometimes people need targeted, time-limited help to get unstuck. Brief therapies emerged from the practical reality that many clients can't afford—financially or emotionally—lengthy treatment. The EPPP expects you to know the major approaches, their techniques, and when to use them.

These aren't watered-down versions of "real" therapy. They're distinct approaches with their own theoretical foundations and evidence bases. {{M}}Think of them as specialized tools rather than a Swiss Army knife—each designed to do specific jobs efficiently.{{/M}}

## Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)

Developed by Klerman and Weissman originally for depression, IPT operates from a medical model perspective. It views mental disorders as treatable illnesses and focuses on how interpersonal factors contribute to symptoms.

### The Three Stages of IPT

| Stage | Focus | Key Activities |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Initial | Diagnosis & context | Identify diagnosis, interpersonal context of symptoms, assign "sick role" |
| Middle | Problem area work | Use strategies like role-playing, communication analysis, encouragement of affect |
| Final | Termination | Address ending therapy, relapse prevention |

### The Four Problem Areas (for Depression)

IPT identifies one primary problem area to target:

1. **Interpersonal role disputes** - conflicts with significant others about expectations
2. **Interpersonal role transitions** - difficulty adjusting to life changes (new job, divorce, retirement)
3. **Interpersonal deficits** - chronic difficulties forming or maintaining relationships
4. **Grief** - complicated bereavement

The "sick role" is a distinctive IPT concept. It allows clients to acknowledge they're ill without self-blame and frames the condition as temporary and treatable. {{M}}It's like getting a doctor's note that says "this person has a real illness" rather than "this person just needs to try harder."{{/M}}

## Solution-Focused Therapy

Created by Steve de Shazer, this approach flips traditional therapy on its head. Instead of digging into what caused the problem, it asks: "What does the solution look like?"

### The Essential Questions

**The Miracle Question**: "If a miracle happened tonight while you were sleeping and your problem was solved, how would you know when you woke up? What would be different?"

This question does several things at once:
- Shifts focus from past to future
- Helps identify concrete treatment goals
- Bypasses resistance by framing change as already having happened

**Exception Questions**: "When was a time recently when the problem didn't happen, or wasn't as bad?"

These questions help clients recognize they already have resources and times of success. {{M}}It's like asking someone who says they "always" lose their keys to remember that one time last week when they put them right by the door.{{/M}}

**Scaling Questions**: "On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is the worst it's ever been and 10 is the problem completely solved, where are you now?"

Scaling questions make abstract problems concrete and measurable. They also help track progress session to session.

### Session Structure

Each session follows a pattern:
1. Ask questions to explore goals and exceptions
2. Provide feedback to the client
3. Assign a task for between sessions

The **formula first session task**: "Between now and our next session, notice what's happening in your life that you want to continue." This immediately focuses clients on what's working.

## Transtheoretical Model (Stages of Change)

Prochaska and DiClemente developed this model by studying how people successfully change behaviors. The key insight: **interventions work best when matched to the client's current stage**.

### The Six Stages

| Stage | Definition | Timeline | Effective Strategies |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| Precontemplation | No intention to change | Not in next 6 months | Consciousness raising, dramatic relief, environmental reevaluation |
| Contemplation | Thinking about change | Within 6 months | Above strategies + self-reevaluation |
| Preparation | Planning to act | Within 1 month | Self-reevaluation, self-liberation |
| Action | Actively changing | Currently | Contingency management, stimulus control, counterconditioning |
| Maintenance | Sustaining change | 6+ months of change | Same as action stage, focus on relapse prevention |
| Termination | Change complete | Low relapse risk | Confident the change is permanent |

**Memory tip**: PC-PAM-T (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, Maintenance, Termination)

### Three Factors Affecting Motivation

1. **Decisional balance** - weighing pros and cons of change; most important during contemplation
2. **Self-efficacy** - confidence in ability to change; crucial for moving from contemplation → preparation → action
3. **Temptation** - urge to engage in the old behavior; strongest in early stages

{{M}}Imagine someone considering whether to quit their comfortable but unfulfilling job. In precontemplation, they're not even thinking about it. In contemplation, they're weighing the pros and cons endlessly. In preparation, they're updating their resume. In action, they're interviewing. In maintenance, they're thriving in the new role.{{/M}}

## Motivational Interviewing (MI)

Miller and Rollnick defined MI as "a method for enhancing intrinsic motivation by exploring and resolving ambivalence." Originally developed for substance use, it now applies broadly.

### Theoretical Foundations

MI draws from multiple sources:
- Rogers's person-centered therapy (empathy, unconditional positive regard)
- Transtheoretical model (matching interventions to stage)
- Bandura's self-efficacy concept
- Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory

### Core Strategies

**Developing discrepancy**: Help clients see the gap between their current behavior and their values/goals. {{M}}It's like holding up a mirror that shows both where someone is and where they want to be.{{/M}}

**Working with client language**:

| Type | Definition | Example | Therapist Goal |
|------|------------|---------|----------------|
| Change talk | Statements favoring change | "I'd probably feel better if I quit smoking" | Elicit and strengthen |
| Sustain talk | Statements favoring status quo | "I'm just not ready to quit" | Reduce |
| Discord | Signals relationship strain | "You don't understand what I'm going through" | Resolve |

### The Decisional Balance Controversy

Miller and Rollnick originally recommended having clients list pros and cons of change. They later revised this:

- **Use decisional balance when**: You want to maintain neutrality while assessing readiness
- **Avoid it when**: Your goal is to promote change (listing cons of change can actually increase resistance)

### MI Effectiveness

Research supports MI as:
- Effective as a standalone treatment
- Beneficial when added before other treatments (e.g., MI before CBT shows greater improvement than CBT alone for anxiety disorders)
- Equally effective via telehealth as in-person for some applications

## Brief Psychodynamic Psychotherapy

This isn't one therapy but a family of time-limited approaches derived from longer psychodynamic work. Different versions focus on different things—some on unconscious conflicts, others on dysfunctional interaction patterns.

### Shared Characteristics

Despite variations, brief psychodynamic therapies share these features:

1. **Change can happen quickly** - or therapy can start a process that continues after termination
2. **Limited, agreed-upon goals** - identified early in treatment
3. **Selective about clients** - works best for those who can benefit from insight and form a therapeutic alliance
4. **Active therapist role** - from the start, to establish alliance and maintain focus
5. **Emphasis on positive transference** - more exploration/education than interpretation
6. **Early termination focus** - address loss and separation concerns from the beginning

{{M}}Unlike traditional psychoanalysis where you might wander through the client's history like exploring a vast library, brief psychodynamic therapy is more like going to a library with a specific research question and a deadline.{{/M}}

## Comparison Table: Brief Therapies at a Glance

| Therapy | Founder(s) | Core Focus | Key Techniques | Best For |
|---------|------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| IPT | Klerman & Weissman | Interpersonal factors | Sick role, role-playing, communication analysis | Depression, eating disorders |
| Solution-Focused | de Shazer | Solutions, not problems | Miracle question, exception questions, scaling | Goal-directed clients |
| TTM/Stages of Change | Prochaska & DiClemente | Matching intervention to stage | Stage-appropriate strategies | Behavior change |
| Motivational Interviewing | Miller & Rollnick | Resolving ambivalence | Developing discrepancy, change talk | Precontemplation/contemplation stages |
| Brief Psychodynamic | Various | Insight (time-limited) | Active therapist, positive transference | Insight-oriented clients |

## Common EPPP Traps

1. **Confusing IPT problem areas**: Role disputes (conflicts about expectations) vs. role transitions (adjusting to changes) vs. deficits (chronic relationship difficulties)

2. **Miracle question purpose**: It's not about fantasizing—it establishes future focus and identifies concrete goals

3. **Stages of change timing**: Precontemplation = no intention to change in next 6 months; Contemplation = intending within 6 months; Preparation = within 1 month

4. **Decisional balance in MI**: Remember the revision—it's not always appropriate and can backfire when the goal is promoting change

5. **Brief psychodynamic client selection**: Not for everyone—clients need capacity for insight and ability to form therapeutic alliance

## Key Takeaways

- **IPT** uses the "sick role" and targets one of four interpersonal problem areas
- **Solution-focused therapy** uses miracle, exception, and scaling questions to focus on solutions rather than problems
- **Transtheoretical model** matches strategies to six stages of change (PC-PAM-T)
- **Motivational interviewing** resolves ambivalence by developing discrepancy and working with change talk
- **Brief psychodynamic** therapies share common features including active therapist role and early termination focus
- All brief therapies are evidence-based and designed for efficient, targeted intervention
