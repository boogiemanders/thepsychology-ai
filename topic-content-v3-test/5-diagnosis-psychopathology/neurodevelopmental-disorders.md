## Understanding Neurodevelopmental Disorders: A Practical Guide for EPPP Success

When you're preparing to become a licensed psychologist, understanding neurodevelopmental disorders isn't just about memorizing criteria—it's about recognizing patterns that can shape a person's entire life trajectory. These disorders start early, often before a child enters school, and they affect how people learn, communicate, move through social situations, and manage daily responsibilities. Let's break down what you need to know in a way that sticks.

## Why This Material Matters for Your Practice

Neurodevelopmental disorders represent some of the most common conditions you'll encounter in practice. {{M}}Think about your own school years—in any classroom of 30 students, statistically at least one had ADHD, and you probably knew someone who struggled with learning to read despite being bright in other areas.{{/M}} Understanding these disorders means you can spot them early, provide appropriate interventions, and help families navigate complex treatment decisions. Plus, this content consistently appears on the EPPP, so getting comfortable with it now pays dividends on test day.

## The Big Picture: What Makes These "Neurodevelopmental"?

All neurodevelopmental disorders share a common thread: they involve developmental deficits that impair functioning in personal, social, academic, or work settings. The key word here is "developmental"—these conditions emerge during the developmental period, typically before adolescence. They're rooted in how the brain develops and functions, not caused by trauma or life circumstances that happen later.

## Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability)

### The Essential Criteria

For this diagnosis, you need three components working together:

1. **Deficits in intellectual functioning** - Confirmed by both clinical assessment and standardized IQ testing (typically two or more standard deviations below the mean, which translates to an IQ around 70 or below)
2. **Deficits in adaptive functioning** - The person struggles to meet age-appropriate standards for independence and social responsibility
3. **Onset during the developmental period** - This started early, not after a brain injury at age 25

### Understanding Severity Levels

Here's where many students get confused: severity isn't primarily about IQ scores anymore. Instead, the DSM-5-TR focuses on adaptive functioning across three domains—conceptual (thinking and problem-solving), social (interpersonal skills), and practical (self-care, job responsibilities). This approach helps determine what level of support someone needs in daily life.

| Severity Level | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| Mild | Needs some support; can often live independently with assistance |
| Moderate | Needs consistent support; may work in supportive settings |
| Severe | Needs substantial daily support across most activities |
| Profound | Needs extensive support for all aspects of daily living |

### What Causes It?

The etiology breaks down into timing categories:

- **Prenatal factors (80-85% of known causes)**: Includes genetic conditions like Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome
- **Perinatal factors (5-10%)**: {{M}}Think of complications during the birth process itself, like a baby experiencing oxygen deprivation during delivery{{/M}}
- **Postnatal factors (5-10%)**: Events after birth, such as traumatic brain injury or severe infections

**EPPP Alert**: Know the difference between Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. Down syndrome results from a chromosomal abnormality (usually an extra copy of chromosome 21) due to errors during cell division—it's not typically inherited. Fragile X syndrome is the most common *inherited* form, caused by a mutated gene on the X chromosome that gets passed down through families.

## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

### Core Diagnostic Requirements

ASD requires two main symptom clusters, and both must be present:

**Cluster 1: Deficits in social communication and interaction**
- Impaired social-emotional reciprocity (limited back-and-forth interaction)
- Impaired nonverbal communication (unusual eye contact, facial expressions, gestures)
- Difficulty developing and maintaining relationships

**Cluster 2: Restrictive and repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities**
- Stereotyped movements or speech
- Insistence on sameness and routines
- Highly restricted, fixated interests
- Unusual sensory responses (hyper- or hypo-reactivity)

### The Face and Emotion Recognition Problem

Research reveals something fascinating about ASD: children with autism process faces differently than neurotypical children. In one pivotal study, children without autism could distinguish between novel and familiar faces, but children with autism treated all faces similarly—though they could still distinguish between novel and familiar objects. {{M}}Imagine if every person you met looked equally unfamiliar to you, even people you'd known for years—that's the kind of challenge many individuals with ASD face when building social connections.{{/M}}

This extends to emotion recognition. People with ASD show deficits in recognizing both basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger) and complex emotions (pride, embarrassment) across all three modalities: face, voice, and body language.

### Prevalence and Gender Differences

The numbers vary by location: globally, about 1% of the population has ASD, but in the United States, the rate is higher—3.2% for 8-year-olds and 2.2% for adults. Males receive diagnoses three to four times more often than females.

### What Predicts Better Outcomes?

Three factors consistently predict better prognosis:
1. IQ over 70
2. Functional language skills by age 5
3. Absence of comorbid mental health problems

### The Biology Behind ASD

**Brain Development**: Children with ASD experience accelerated brain growth starting around 6 months, leading to larger head circumference and increased brain volume during early childhood. This plateaus by preschool years. Key structures affected include the cerebellum, corpus callosum, and amygdala.

**Neurotransmitters**: The serotonin paradox is worth remembering—people with ASD often have *lower* serotonin in the brain but *elevated* serotonin in the blood. One explanation: before the blood-brain barrier fully matures, serotonin from the blood enters the developing fetal brain and damages serotonergic neurons. Other implicated neurotransmitters include dopamine, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine.

**Genetics and Environment**: Twin studies show heritability around 62%, with concordance rates of 59-84% for identical twins versus 3.5-29% for fraternal twins. Environmental risk factors include very premature birth (before 26 weeks), prenatal exposure to certain drugs like valproic acid, and advanced parental age.

**Critical Point**: Despite extensive research, no link has been established between childhood vaccinations and ASD. This comes up regularly in clinical practice, so know the evidence.

### Treatment Approaches

**Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI)** is the gold standard nonpharmacological treatment. Based on applied behavior analysis (ABA), the classic Lovaas method involved 40+ hours per week of behavioral interventions using shaping and discrimination training. Research shows EIBI has the strongest impact on intelligence and language acquisition, with smaller effects on adaptive skills and social functioning.

**Medications** don't treat core ASD symptoms but can address associated problems:
- Psychostimulants (like methylphenidate) for comorbid ADHD
- SSRIs for depression and anxiety
- Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, aripiprazole) for irritability, aggression, and self-injury

## Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

### The Diagnostic Picture

ADHD requires a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that meets these criteria:
- Lasts at least six months
- Onset before age 12
- Present in at least two settings ({{M}}not just acting up at work but also struggling at home{{/M}})
- Interferes with functioning

**Number of symptoms required**:
- Ages 16 and under: At least 6 symptoms from either category
- Ages 17 and up: At least 5 symptoms from either category

### The Three Presentations

| Presentation | What You'll See |
|--------------|----------------|
| Predominantly Inattentive | Difficulty sustaining attention, organizing tasks, following through on instructions, easily distracted |
| Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive | Fidgeting, inability to stay seated, excessive talking, interrupting others, difficulty waiting turn |
| Combined | Both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms meet threshold |

### Inattention Symptoms to Remember

People with inattention don't listen when spoken to directly, fail to pay attention to details, don't follow through on instructions, get easily distracted, and frequently forget daily activities. {{M}}If you've ever had a colleague who consistently misses deadlines, loses important documents, and spaces out during meetings despite genuinely trying to focus—that's what significant inattention looks like in adult life.{{/M}}

### Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Symptoms

Watch for inability to engage in activities quietly, inappropriate running or climbing, excessive talking, and interrupting or intruding on others.

### Prevalence and Gender Patterns

ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed disorder among youth ages 3-17 in the United States. The male-to-female ratio is 2:1 in childhood but narrows to about 1.6:1 in adulthood.

### How ADHD Changes in Adulthood

Most people with childhood ADHD continue experiencing at least some core symptoms as adults, but the symptoms transform:

- **Hyperactivity**: Motor restlessness decreases, replaced by inability to relax, impatience, and internal restlessness
- **Impulsivity**: Slightly decreases but manifests as reckless driving, abruptly quitting jobs, ending relationships impulsively, overspending
- **Inattention**: Persists most stubbornly, showing up as missed deadlines, careless mistakes, procrastination—especially with boring or tedious tasks

### The Neurobiology

**Brain structures involved**:
- Prefrontal cortex, striatum (caudate and putamen), and thalamus: linked to executive functioning deficits
- Prefrontal cortex and cerebellum: associated with temporal information processing problems
- Prefrontal cortex and amygdala: connected to emotion dysregulation

Children with ADHD show reduced total brain volume with smaller volumes in prefrontal cortex, striatum, corpus callosum, and cerebellum, plus reduced activity in these regions.

**Neurotransmitters**: Low dopamine and norepinephrine levels are most consistently implicated, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, affecting impulse control, attention, and executive functioning.

### Genetics

Twin studies report average heritability of 74%, with concordance rates of 62.8-79.3% for identical twins and 21.2-39% for fraternal twins. Since identical twins don't show 100% concordance, environmental factors matter. Discordant twins differ in birth weight, time in incubators, and motor skill acquisition.

### Comorbidity Alert

Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is the most common comorbid condition. About half of children with combined presentation also have ODD.

### Age-Appropriate Treatment Recommendations

The American Academy of Pediatrics provides clear guidelines:

**Preschool children**: Behavioral interventions first, particularly parent training in behavioral management (PTBM) programs like positive parenting or parent-child interaction therapy. Medication only if behavioral approaches fail.

**Elementary/Middle school**: Combination of medication and behavioral interventions at home and school.

**Adolescents**: Medication with the teen's assent, plus behavioral and instructional interventions when available (behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, mindfulness training).

**Adults**: Medication as first-line treatment, with cognitive-behavioral therapy having the strongest psychosocial support.

### The Medication and Substance Use Question

{{M}}Many parents worry that giving their child stimulant medication for ADHD is like opening the door to future drug problems.{{/M}} However, research shows that children with ADHD who receive psychostimulant treatment have similar rates of future substance use disorders as children with ADHD who don't receive stimulants. The medication neither increases nor decreases risk for later substance problems.

## Tic Disorders

### Understanding Tics

A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization. Motor tics include eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and echopraxia (imitating others' movements). Vocal tics include throat clearing, barking, and echolalia (repeating others' words).

### The Three Tic Disorder Diagnoses

| Disorder | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| Tourette's Disorder | Multiple motor tics AND at least one vocal tic; persisted >1 year; onset before age 18 |
| Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder | Motor OR vocal tics (not both types); persisted >1 year; onset before age 18 |
| Provisional Tic Disorder | Motor and/or vocal tics; present <1 year; onset before age 18 |

Tics typically begin between ages 4-6 and peak in severity between ages 10-12. ADHD is the most common comorbid disorder with Tourette's.

### Treatment Options

Medications include antipsychotics (like haloperidol) for tics themselves, plus medications for comorbid conditions. The behavioral treatment with the strongest support is Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT), which combines psychoeducation, social support, habit reversal, competing response training, and relaxation.

## Communication Disorders

### Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)

This disorder involves disturbed fluency and speech timing inappropriate for the person's age and language skills. Look for sound/syllable repetitions, sound prolongations, broken words, blocking, circumlocutions, excessive tension when speaking, or whole-word repetitions.

Onset typically occurs between ages 2-7. Good news: 65-85% of children recover from dysfluency. The severity of symptoms at age 8 strongly predicts whether symptoms will persist or resolve.

**Treatment**: Habit reversal training incorporating competing response training—for stuttering, this means regulated breathing.

## Specific Learning Disorder

### Core Diagnostic Criteria

The person must show difficulties with academic skills lasting at least six months despite targeted interventions. Look for at least one of these six symptoms:

1. Inaccurate or slow, effortful word reading
2. Difficulty understanding what's read
3. Spelling difficulties
4. Problems with written expression
5. Trouble with number sense, facts, or calculation
6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning

Academic skills must be substantially below age expectations, interfere with functioning, have onset during school years, and not be better explained by another condition.

### The Numbers

About 5-15% of school-age children have a specific learning disorder. Of these, approximately 80% have a reading disorder. The most common reading disorder is dyslexia, and the most common type of dyslexia is dysphonic (also called dysphonetic, auditory, or phonological) dyslexia—which involves difficulty connecting sounds to letters.

### Important Characteristics

People with specific learning disorders typically have average to above-average IQ but elevated rates of other problems. ADHD is the most common comorbid psychiatric disorder.

## Common Misconceptions Students Make

**Misconception 1**: "IQ scores alone determine severity of intellectual disability."
- **Reality**: Severity levels are based on adaptive functioning across conceptual, social, and practical domains, not just IQ.

**Misconception 2**: "All people with ASD avoid eye contact completely."
- **Reality**: Eye contact patterns vary widely; some make atypical or fleeting eye contact rather than none at all.

**Misconception 3**: "ADHD is always obvious because kids are bouncing off the walls."
- **Reality**: The predominantly inattentive presentation can be subtle and often goes undiagnosed, especially in females.

**Misconception 4**: "Children outgrow ADHD."
- **Reality**: Most people continue experiencing at least some core symptoms into adulthood, though symptoms may change form.

**Misconception 5**: "Learning disorders mean low intelligence."
- **Reality**: People with specific learning disorders typically have average or above-average IQ—that's part of what defines it as a learning disorder rather than intellectual disability.

## Memory Strategies for EPPP Success

**For ASD diagnostic criteria**, remember "Social Communication + Restricted Repetitive" (both required). {{M}}Think "SC+RR" like a sports car model name{{/M}}—you need both letters in the name.

**For ADHD symptom counts**, use the rule: **6 until sweet 16, then 5 at 17+**. Under 17 needs six symptoms; 17 and up needs five.

**For Down vs. Fragile X**: Down = chromosomal abnormality (not typically inherited). Fragile X = inherited genetic mutation on X chromosome.

**For tic disorders**, the timeline matters: Tourette's and persistent tic disorder require >1 year; provisional tic disorder is <1 year.

**For ASD treatment hierarchy**: EIBI (behavioral intervention) has the strongest evidence for core symptoms. Medications treat associated problems, not core ASD symptoms.

**For ADHD treatment by age**: Preschool = behavior first; Elementary/middle = combination; Adolescent = medication plus behavioral options; Adult = medication first-line, CBT for psychosocial.

## Key Takeaways

- **Neurodevelopmental disorders begin early** (usually before school age) and affect multiple areas of functioning throughout life

- **Intellectual disability requires three components**: low intellectual functioning, impaired adaptive functioning, and developmental period onset—with severity based on adaptive functioning, not just IQ

- **ASD diagnosis needs both** deficits in social communication AND restricted/repetitive behaviors—both clusters are required

- **ASD prognosis improves with** IQ >70, functional language by age 5, and no comorbid mental health problems

- **ADHD is the most prevalent diagnosed disorder** in youth ages 3-17 in the US, with symptoms persisting into adulthood for most people (though symptoms transform)

- **ADHD comorbidity**: ODD is most common, affecting about half of children with combined presentation

- **Treatment age matters**: For ADHD, recommended approaches differ by developmental stage—behavior-focused for preschoolers, combined approaches for school-age, medication-primary for adults

- **Stimulant medication for ADHD** neither increases nor decreases risk for future substance use disorders

- **Tourette's disorder requires** multiple motor tics PLUS at least one vocal tic, persisting >1 year, onset before age 18

- **Most common specific learning disorder**: Reading disorder (80% of cases), with dysphonic dyslexia being the most common type

- **Genetics play significant roles**: Twin study heritability estimates are 62% for ASD and 74% for ADHD

- **Brain volume patterns differ**: Children with ASD show accelerated early brain growth; children with ADHD show reduced total brain volume in key regions

When you're sitting for the EPPP, these disorders will likely appear in multiple questions across different formats. Understanding not just the criteria but also the developmental course, treatment approaches, and neurobiological foundations will help you answer questions confidently. Remember: this isn't just about test day—this is knowledge you'll use throughout your career every time you conduct an assessment, make a diagnosis, or develop a treatment plan.
