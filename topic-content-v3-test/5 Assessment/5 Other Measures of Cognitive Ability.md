## Why These Tests Matter for Your Future Practice

You've probably heard of the Wechsler and Stanford-Binet tests – they're the celebrities of cognitive assessment. But here's the thing: in your actual practice, you'll encounter clients who need different tools. Maybe you'll work with a child who has cerebral palsy, a refugee teenager with limited English, or an adult with autism spectrum disorder. That's when knowing about these other cognitive measures becomes crucial. This isn't just exam trivia – it's about having the right tool for each unique person who walks into your office.

Let's explore the full toolkit of cognitive assessments you need to know for the EPPP and your career.

## Individual Tests: Matching the Right Tool to the Right Person

### Tests Based on Brain Processing Models

**Cognitive Assessment System, Second Edition (CAS2)**

The CAS2 takes a different approach than traditional IQ tests. Instead of focusing on verbal and performance abilities, it looks at how the brain actually processes information. It's designed for kids ages 5 to 18 and is based on Luria's PASS theory. PASS stands for:

- **Planning**: How you figure out what to do and make decisions
- **Attention**: How you focus and ignore distractions
- **Simultaneous processing**: How you see the big picture (understanding how pieces fit together)
- **Successive processing**: How you understand things in order (like following steps)

{{M}}Think of PASS like different ways you might navigate a new city. Planning is choosing your route before you start. Attention is staying focused on road signs despite all the visual noise. Simultaneous processing is understanding the overall layout of the city from a map. Successive processing is following turn-by-turn GPS directions.{{/M}}

This test is particularly useful when you suspect a child has specific processing difficulties rather than general intellectual problems.

### Tests for When Words Get in the Way

**Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Fifth Edition (PPVT-5)**

The PPVT-5 measures receptive vocabulary – basically, what words someone understands when they hear them. It works for ages 2.5 years all the way up to 90+. Here's how it works: You show someone four pictures and say a word. They point to the picture that matches the word. That's it. No speaking required. No writing. No reading.

This simplicity makes it perfect for several situations:
- Someone who can't speak due to a motor disorder
- A person recovering from a stroke affecting speech
- Anyone with physical disabilities that make writing difficult

The test pairs with the Expressive Vocabulary Test-Third Edition (EVT-3), which measures the flip side – what words someone can actually produce. {{M}}If the PPVT-5 measures what groceries someone recognizes in a store, the EVT-3 measures which ones they can name and describe.{{/M}}

**Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II)**

The KABC-II was designed with cultural fairness in mind – a big deal in our diverse world. It's for ages 3 to 18 years and minimizes cultural content and verbal requirements. You can interpret results using two different models:

1. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of cognitive abilities
2. Luria's neuropsychological processing model

The flexibility matters because you can choose the interpretation approach that makes sense for your client. If you're working with a refugee child whose crystallized knowledge (learned facts and skills from their culture) wouldn't fairly represent their abilities, you'd use Luria's model instead.

The test provides scores on five scales:
- Simultaneous processing
- Sequential processing
- Planning
- Learning
- Knowledge

**Columbia Mental Maturity Scale-Third Edition (CMMS)**

Originally developed for children with cerebral palsy, the CMMS is for kids ages 3.5 to 9 years and measures general reasoning ability. The child looks at cards with three to five pictures and points to the one that doesn't belong. No talking. No fine motor skills needed beyond pointing.

This test is your go-to when working with:
- Children with cerebral palsy or other motor impairments
- Kids with sensory disabilities
- Children with speech difficulties
- Young clients with limited English proficiency

**Leiter International Performance Scale-Third Edition (Leiter-3)**

The Leiter-3 is the Swiss Army knife of nonverbal cognitive assessment, covering ages 3 to 75+. You can administer it completely without verbal instructions, and clients just match response cards to corresponding illustrations. It emphasizes fluid intelligence (reasoning and problem-solving with new information) and measures:

- Visualization
- Reasoning
- Memory
- Attention

This test is particularly valuable for:
- People with cognitive delays
- Those with speech or hearing impairments
- Individuals with autism spectrum disorder
- Anyone with limited English proficiency

**Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM)**

Raven's SPM is elegant in its simplicity. It shows you 60 incomplete patterns (matrices), and you choose which piece completes each pattern. That's the whole test. But don't let the simplicity fool you – it's measuring abstract reasoning and fluid intelligence, relatively free from cultural and educational influences.

For ages 6 and up, the instructions are so simple they can be pantomimed. This makes it perfect for similar populations as the Leiter-3. Here's something especially important: research has shown Raven's SPM is less likely than Wechsler tests to underestimate intelligence in people with autism spectrum disorder. This matters because using the wrong test could lead to incorrect conclusions about someone's abilities.

### Two Tests to Remember for Cultural Fairness

When you need to minimize cultural bias or language barriers, your top two choices are:
1. **KABC-II**: Designed specifically to be culturally fair
2. **Raven's SPM**: Minimal cultural content, simple instructions

{{M}}These tests are like universal adapters for electrical outlets when traveling – they work across different "systems" without requiring specific cultural or linguistic "voltage."{{/M}}

## Group Tests: When You Need Efficiency at Scale

Not every assessment happens one-on-one. Sometimes organizations need to evaluate many people efficiently.

| Test | Purpose | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Wonderlic Cognitive Ability Test | Hiring decisions | 12 minutes, 50 items (verbal, numerical, spatial) |
| Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT7) | Educational planning | Grades 2-12, predicts academic performance, identifies gifted/at-risk students |

**The Wonderlic** is particularly common in employment settings. {{M}}It's like a speed dating version of intelligence testing – quick but surprisingly informative.{{/M}} Just 12 minutes for 50 questions covering different cognitive abilities.

**The CogAT7** measures three domains (verbal, quantitative, and nonverbal) and helps schools make decisions about placement, gifted programs, and interventions for struggling students.

## College Admissions Tests: Predicting Academic Success

**Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)**

The SAT is part of a larger assessment system for grades 8 through 12 (including the PSATs for younger students). It's norm-referenced, meaning scores are compared to a standardization sample. The test measures "college readiness" through:
- Reading
- Writing and language
- Math
- Optional essay (covering reading, analysis, and writing)

**Graduate Record Exam (GRE)**

The GRE comes in two versions:

1. **General Test**: Used for graduate school admissions, measuring general academic skills:
   - Verbal reasoning
   - Quantitative reasoning
   - Analytical reasoning

2. **Subject Tests**: Assess knowledge in specific fields (biology, chemistry, literature in English, mathematics, physics, and psychology)

{{M}}If the SAT is like a general health screening before college, the GRE Subject Tests are like specialized diagnostic tests for your field of study.{{/M}}

These tests matter for your EPPP preparation because they represent how cognitive abilities are assessed in educational contexts, and you might consult on their interpretation or validity in your practice.

## The Youngest Clients: Infant and Toddler Assessment

Assessing babies and toddlers requires completely different approaches. They can't follow instructions or answer questions, so we have to get creative.

**Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII)**

For infants 3 to 12 months old, the FTII measures something fascinating: how long babies look at new things. This capitalizes on a principle called **novelty preference** – babies naturally look longer at new stimuli than familiar ones.

The test measures:
- Selective attention
- Recognition memory

Research has shown that information processing during infancy actually predicts later childhood IQ. {{M}}It's like seeing early indicators of future weather patterns – certain signs in infancy can tell us something about cognitive development down the road.{{/M}}

**Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition (Bayley-4)**

The Bayley-4 is the gold standard for assessing developmental status in children from 16 days to 42 months. It evaluates five domains:

- Cognitive
- Motor
- Language
- Social-emotional
- Adaptive behavior

There's also a screening version (Bayley-4 Screening Test) that covers three domains (cognitive, motor, language) to determine if a full assessment is needed. {{M}}The screening test is like a triage nurse – it quickly identifies who needs more comprehensive evaluation.{{/M}}

## The Future of Testing: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT)

Computerized adaptive testing represents a major evolution in assessment. Here's how it works: Instead of everyone answering the same questions, the computer tailors the test to each person's ability level.

**How CAT Works:**

1. You start with a moderately difficult question
2. If you answer correctly → next question is harder
3. If you answer incorrectly → next question is easier
4. This continues until the computer has enough information to accurately estimate your ability level

{{M}}It's like a GPS constantly recalculating your route based on where you actually are, rather than following a predetermined path regardless of your location.{{/M}}

**Advantages of CAT:**

1. **Efficiency**: Can reduce testing time by 50% or more
2. **Precision**: Can assess everyone at the same level of accuracy
3. **Security**: Each person sees different questions, reducing cheating
4. **Motivation**: Questions match ability level – not too easy, not too hard

**Disadvantages of CAT:**

1. **Development costs**: Expensive and time-consuming to create
2. **No review**: Usually can't go back to previous questions
3. **Technical requirements**: Needs computers and reliable technology

CAT typically uses **item response theory (IRT)** in development. IRT allows test developers to know exactly how difficult each question is and create an item bank with questions ranging from very easy to very difficult. This matters because the computer needs to know which question to serve up next based on previous responses.

## A Quick Reference Table for Test Selection

| Client Characteristic | Best Test Options |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Motor impairments | PPVT-5, CMMS, Leiter-3, Raven's SPM |
| Limited English | KABC-II, CMMS, Leiter-3, Raven's SPM |
| Speech/hearing impairments | PPVT-5, CMMS, Leiter-3, Raven's SPM |
| Autism spectrum disorder | Leiter-3, Raven's SPM |
| Minimizing cultural bias | KABC-II, Raven's SPM |
| Ages 3-12 months | FTII |
| Ages 16 days-42 months | Bayley-4 |
| Ages 3-18 with processing concerns | CAS2 |
| Employment screening | Wonderlic |
| Educational planning (K-12) | CogAT7 |

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception 1: "Nonverbal tests measure the same thing as verbal IQ tests"**

Not true. Nonverbal tests typically emphasize fluid intelligence (reasoning with new information) while minimizing crystallized intelligence (learned knowledge). They're measuring different aspects of cognitive ability.

**Misconception 2: "The PPVT-5 is a complete intelligence test"**

It's not. The PPVT-5 measures only receptive vocabulary. While vocabulary correlates with intelligence, it's just one piece. Don't use it as a comprehensive IQ test.

**Misconception 3: "Any test can be used with any population"**

Wrong. Test selection matters enormously. Using a verbally-loaded test with someone who has limited English proficiency will underestimate their actual cognitive abilities. Match the test to the client's needs.

**Misconception 4: "Computer adaptive tests are always better"**

Not necessarily. While they have advantages, some examinees prefer reviewing previous answers, which CAT often doesn't allow. Also, CAT requires significant resources to develop.

**Misconception 5: "Infant tests predict adult IQ perfectly"**

They don't. While tests like the FTII show predictive validity, infant assessment is better for identifying developmental delays than predicting exact future IQ scores.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**Create categories in your mind:**

1. **Nonverbal tests**: CMMS, Leiter-3, Raven's SPM (no speaking required)
2. **Culturally fair**: KABC-II, Raven's SPM (minimal cultural content)
3. **Baby tests**: FTII (3-12 months), Bayley-4 (16 days-42 months)
4. **Processing-based**: CAS2 with PASS theory

**Use the acronym PASS for CAS2:**
- **P**lanning
- **A**ttention
- **S**imultaneous
- **S**uccessive

**Remember the "two Rs" for minimal bias:**
- **R**aven's
- **R**einterpreted (KABC-II, which can be interpreted in culturally appropriate ways)

**For test selection, ask yourself three questions:**
1. Can my client speak clearly?
2. Does my client have strong English skills?
3. Does my client have motor difficulties?

Your answers guide you toward the appropriate test.

**Memory hook for CAT**: {{M}}Think "Choose And Tailor" – the computer chooses and tailors questions to each person.{{/M}}

## Key Takeaways

- **The CAS2** is unique in measuring PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, Successive processing) based on Luria's theory, for ages 5-18
