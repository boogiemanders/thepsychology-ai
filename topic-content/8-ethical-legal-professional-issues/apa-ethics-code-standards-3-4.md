## Why These Standards Matter More Than You Think

You're scrolling through your phone at a coffee shop, and a former client walks by. They wave and start chatting about their current struggles. Your supervisor texts asking about a case. A parent demands to see their 17-year-old's therapy notes. A couple you're seeing separately keeps asking what the other partner said in private sessions.

Welcome to the daily reality of ethical decision-making. Standards 3 and 4 of the APA Ethics Code aren't abstract rules gathering dust in a textbook—they're your navigation system for the messy, complicated situations you'll face regularly in practice. Think of them as your professional GPS, helping you avoid ethical crashes while keeping your clients safe and your license intact.

## The Foundation: Human Relations (Standard 3)

Standard 3 covers how psychologists interact with people—clients, students, supervisees, research participants, and colleagues. It's essentially the "how to be a decent human while also being a professional" section of the Ethics Code.

### Discrimination: When Referrals Are Ethical (But Refusing Service Usually Isn't)

Here's what trips people up: The Ethics Code prohibits discrimination based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics protected by law. But this doesn't mean you must accept every single person who contacts you for services.

The key distinction: You can refer someone when you genuinely believe you can't provide *competent* services—not because you simply don't like working with their "type." It's like a mechanic who specializes in European cars referring someone with a classic American muscle car to a specialist. The issue is competence, not preference.

**Ethical referral**: "I don't have specific training in treating OCD, so I'm referring you to a colleague who specializes in exposure therapy."

**Unethical refusal**: "I don't work with people who identify as transgender" (when you have the competence to provide services).

You can also ethically refuse services when someone is unwilling or unable to pay your fees. This isn't discrimination—it's a legitimate business consideration.

### Sexual Harassment: When Does Uncomfortable Become Unethical?

Sexual harassment in the Ethics Code includes sexual solicitation, physical advances, or sexual conduct (verbal or nonverbal) that falls into two categories:

1. **The "I told you to stop" category**: Behavior that's unwelcome or offensive, creates a hostile environment, and you've been told it's a problem
2. **The "obviously wrong" category**: Behavior so severe or intense that a reasonable person would find it abusive

The tricky part? Some situations are crystal clear (quid pro quo—"sleep with me and I'll give you an A"), while others exist in a gray zone. Occasional off-color jokes might be inappropriate but not necessarily harassment. However—and this is critical—once you've been told the behavior is unwelcome, continuing it crosses into harassment territory.

Think of it like your personal space bubble. What feels comfortable varies by person, but once someone says "you're in my space," you need to back up. Continuing to crowd them after that warning? That's when you've crossed the line.

### Avoiding Harm: When "Ouch" Is Actually Okay

Standard 3.04 requires psychologists to avoid causing harm and minimize unavoidable harm. But here's the nuance: not all painful experiences count as unethical harm.

Assigning a failing grade to a student who didn't master the material? That might hurt their feelings, but it's a legitimate professional action. Diagnosing someone with a condition that disqualifies them from disability benefits? Also painful but not unethical if it's accurate.

The standard focuses on harm that results from negligence, incompetence, or ethical violations—not legitimate professional activities that happen to have negative consequences.

### Multiple Relationships: The Tangled Web We Navigate

This is where things get interesting. A multiple relationship exists when you have a professional relationship with someone and *simultaneously* (or by promise) have another relationship with them or someone close to them.

The Ethics Code doesn't ban all multiple relationships—just those that could "reasonably be expected to impair your objectivity, competence, or effectiveness" or risk exploitation or harm.

**Common scenarios and their complications:**

| Situation | Why It's Problematic | What Could Go Wrong |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Post-therapy friendship | Blocks client from returning to therapy; you can't provide future professional services | Client has crisis, can't return; you can't testify for them in court |
| Conducting custody evaluation with current therapy client | Therapeutic and evaluative roles conflict | Your therapy relationship biases the evaluation; client feels betrayed |
| Supervising your close friend's clinical work | Personal relationship impairs objectivity | You can't give honest critical feedback; friend's clients potentially harmed |
| Recommending clients buy a product you financially benefit from | Conflict of interest | Clients question if recommendation is for their benefit or yours |

**Gottlieb's Decision-Making Model** offers three factors to consider:

1. **Power differential**: How much power do you hold over the other person?
2. **Duration**: How long will both relationships last?
3. **Clarity of termination**: How clear is the end point of each relationship?

The greater the power gap, the longer the relationships, and the murkier the endings, the more problematic the multiple relationship becomes. It's like dating someone who reports directly to you at work—the power imbalance creates too many opportunities for problems, even with good intentions.

### Third-Party Requests: Who's Actually Your Client?

Imagine you're hired by a law firm to evaluate someone's competency to stand trial. Or a company contracts you to assess an employee. Or a court orders you to conduct a custody evaluation. In these situations, who's your client?

Standard 3.07 requires you to clarify this upfront with everyone involved. You need to explain:
- Your specific role (therapist, evaluator, consultant, expert witness)
- Who the actual client is
- How the information will be used
- Any limits to confidentiality

Generally, when providing health services, the person receiving services is the client. But in forensic work, the client is typically whoever contracted and pays you—the attorney, court, or agency. The person being evaluated is the *examinee*, not the client.

This matters because it shapes your ethical obligations. It's like being hired to inspect a house for potential buyers versus being the buyers' personal consultant—your role and loyalties shift.

### Informed Consent: More Complicated Than It Sounds

You must obtain informed consent using understandable language before providing services—unless it's mandated by law (like court-ordered evaluations) or the Ethics Code provides an exception.

#### Special Populations and Consent Challenges

**Minors**: Most people under 18 can't legally consent to treatment, so you need permission from their parent or legal guardian. However, exceptions exist:

- Emancipated minors
- "Mature minors" (deemed sufficiently mature to consent)
- Minors with specific conditions (substance abuse, STDs in many states)
- Emergency situations where consent is presumed

When treating minors, you need to obtain parental permission, explain the treatment in age-appropriate terms to the minor, and get the minor's *assent* (agreement to participate).

**The divorced parents dilemma**: Court orders specify whether one or both parents must consent. Even when one parent's consent is legally sufficient, it's often clinically wise to get both on board—otherwise, the non-consenting parent might sabotage treatment.

**Court-ordered services**: You still need to inform the person about the nature of services and confidentiality limits, even though their consent isn't required. Think of it like reading someone their Miranda rights—they have to participate, but they deserve to know what's happening.

### Interrupting Services: Planning for the Unexpected

Life happens. You get sick, relocate, retire, or—let's be honest—eventually die. Your clients experience financial hardships or move away. Standard 3.12 requires you to plan ahead for these interruptions.

The professional equivalent of disaster preparedness includes:
- Discussing potential interruptions with clients early in treatment
- Having a plan for coverage when you're unavailable
- Creating a **professional will** that designates someone to handle your practice if you die suddenly

Your professional executor should ideally be another psychologist who understands ethical obligations—not your spouse or sibling, who faces conflicts of interest when handling your professional responsibilities while also grieving.

## Privacy and Confidentiality (Standard 4)

If Standard 3 is about relationships, Standard 4 is about secrets—specifically, how to protect them and when to ethically break them.

### Discussing Confidentiality Limits: Having "The Talk"

You must discuss confidentiality limits with clients at the start of your relationship and revisit them as circumstances change. It's like explaining the terms and conditions before someone signs up for a service—except people actually need to understand what they're agreeing to.

#### Context-Specific Confidentiality Conversations

**Couples and family therapy**: You need to clarify upfront whether information shared individually will be kept confidential. Imagine one partner confesses an affair in an individual session. Will you keep this secret in joint sessions, or is everything potentially shareable?

Many therapists use a "no secrets" policy, explaining that information shared individually might be brought into joint sessions. Others maintain individual confidentiality. Either approach can work, but you must be clear and consistent.

**Group therapy**: You can't guarantee confidentiality because other group members aren't bound by professional ethics. It's like telling secrets in a room full of people—you can ask them not to share, but you can't control what they do after they leave.

Best practice involves:
- Discussing confidentiality importance during screening
- Addressing it in the first group session
- Reinforcing it throughout treatment
- Reminding members in the final session

**Minors**: Generally, parents have the right to information about their child's treatment. The key is establishing a confidentiality agreement early that specifies what you will and won't share with parents.

A common approach: "I'll keep most of what your teen tells me confidential to build trust, but I'll contact you if they're engaging in behaviors that put their safety at risk—like suicidal ideation, serious substance abuse, or dangerous activities. And when possible, I'll tell your teen beforehand what I'm sharing."

**Military settings**: Confidentiality is more limited in military contexts due to Department of Defense regulations. You need to provide detailed informed consent explaining that confidentiality can never be fully guaranteed and maintain conservative documentation.

**Correctional facilities**: Confidentiality exists on a spectrum here, from essentially none (court-ordered assessments) to near-normal levels (some therapeutic relationships). The actual level usually falls somewhere between these extremes.

Treatment-driven decisions prioritize the therapeutic relationship and strict confidentiality. Security-driven decisions respect confidentiality but prioritize safety when values conflict—like reporting an inmate's credible threat against staff members.

**Telepsychology**: Virtual sessions introduce unique privacy risks. Protecting confidentiality requires:
- Delivering services from private, soundproof spaces
- Discussing with clients how to ensure their privacy
- Using password-protected devices with current security software
- Employing HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing platforms (Zoom for Healthcare, Doxy.me, Spruce—but NOT regular consumer Skype)
- Encrypting emails and stored data

### When Confidentiality Must Be Broken: The Legal Exceptions

Standard 4.05 permits disclosing confidential information with client authorization OR without authorization when legally mandated or permitted for valid purposes like protecting people from harm.

#### Critical Situations Requiring Disclosure

**Suicide risk**: When a client is at high risk for suicide, protecting their safety trumps confidentiality. This might mean contacting family or arranging hospitalization.

Note: No-suicide contracts don't prevent suicide or protect you from liability. They're not a sufficient intervention on their own.

**Child abuse and neglect**: Mandatory reporting laws require psychologists to report suspected abuse or neglect to designated authorities. Many jurisdictions extend this to other vulnerable populations like older adults and adults with disabilities.

**The Tarasoff duty**: This landmark California case established that psychologists have a duty to protect identifiable third parties when clients make clear, imminent threats of physical harm and have the ability to carry out the threat.

When Tarasoff applies, you might need to:
- Warn the intended victim
- Notify police
- Hospitalize the client

**The HIV dilemma**: This gets ethically complex. APA's position supports disclosure only when:
- You know an identifiable person is at significant risk
- You reasonably believe the person doesn't know the client is HIV+
- The client refuses or is unreliable about informing the person

However, state laws vary—some require or permit disclosure, while others prohibit it. You must know your jurisdiction's laws and consult with colleagues and attorneys.

#### Disclosing Information Ethically

Even when disclosure is permitted, you should only share information "germane to the purpose" (Standard 4.04). If you're consulting with a colleague, disguise identifying information unless you have authorization. When writing about cases publicly, changing names isn't enough—modify other identifiers like locations, family composition, and specific dates.

### Client Access to Records: Who Gets to See What?

The Ethics Code doesn't directly address record access, but HIPAA does. Clients generally have the right to inspect and obtain their protected health information (PHI).

However, you can deny access when you reasonably believe it would endanger the client or another person.

**For minor clients**: Parents typically have access to their children's PHI as legal representatives, unless prohibited by law (like when teens legally consent to their own treatment).

**When minors become adults**: They gain all HIPAA rights regarding their own PHI, including information from when they were minors. Parents generally lose automatic access at this point.

### Confidentiality vs. Privilege: Understanding the Difference

These terms aren't interchangeable:

| Confidentiality | Privilege |
|----------------|-----------|
| Ethical obligation (and sometimes legal requirement) | Legal right specific to court proceedings |
| Applies in all professional contexts | Applies only in legal settings |
| Psychologist's responsibility | Client's right (client or their representative decides whether to claim or waive) |

You can claim privilege *on behalf of* a client when asked to disclose information in legal proceedings. But the court determines whether legal exceptions apply—like competency evaluations, malpractice suits against the therapist, or cases where someone uses their mental status as a legal claim or defense.

## Common Misconceptions That Trip People Up

**Myth 1**: "I can never have any other relationship with a client."
**Reality**: Multiple relationships aren't automatically unethical—only those that impair your objectivity or risk harm. The Ethics Code recognizes that, especially in small communities, some boundary crossings are unavoidable.

**Myth 2**: "Confidentiality is absolute in therapy."
**Reality**: Confidentiality has legally defined limits, and clients need to understand these limits from the start.

**Myth 3**: "If I get a no-suicide contract, I'm protected if something happens."
**Reality**: These contracts don't prevent suicide or protect you legally. They shouldn't be your sole intervention.

**Myth 4**: "I can refuse to see anyone I want—it's my practice."
**Reality**: You can't refuse based on characteristics like race, gender, or sexual orientation. Refusals must be based on legitimate factors like competence or payment concerns.

**Myth 5**: "Parents always have access to everything about their child's therapy."
**Reality**: Laws vary, and in some circumstances (like when teens legally consent to their own treatment), parental access is limited.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For multiple relationships**, use the acronym **DPD**: 
- **D**uration (how long?)
- **P**ower (who holds it?)
- **D**efinition (how clear are the boundaries?)

Higher on all three = more problematic.

**For confidentiality limits**, think **SCHAPT**:
- **S**uicide risk
- **C**hild abuse
- **H**arm to others (Tarasoff)
- **A**ged/vulnerable adult abuse
- **P**rivilege exceptions in court
- **T**hird-party situations (clarify from the start)

**For informed consent with minors**, remember **PAP**:
- **P**ermission from parents (usually)
- **A**ssent from the child
- **P**rovide age-appropriate explanation

**For telepsychology confidentiality**: **HELPS**
- **H**IPAA-compliant platform
- **E**ncryption for communications
- **L**ocation (private, secure spaces)
- **P**assword protection
- **S**ecurity software updated

## Key Takeaways

- **Discrimination is prohibited**, but referrals based on competence concerns are ethical
- **Multiple relationships** aren't automatically wrong—evaluate using power, duration, and boundary clarity
- **Sexual harassment** becomes clear-cut once you've been told the behavior is unwelcome and you continue anyway
- **Informed consent** must happen at the start of services using understandable language, with special considerations for minors, court-ordered services, and third-party requests
- **Clarify who your client is** in third-party situations—it might be the person paying you, not the person you're evaluating
- **Discuss confidentiality limits early** and revisit them as circumstances change
- **Confidentiality can be breached** legally when mandated by law or when necessary to protect people from harm
- **Tarasoff** applies when clients make clear, imminent threats against identifiable victims and have the means to act
- **Confidentiality differs by context**—military, correctional, group, and couples settings each have unique considerations
- **Privilege is not confidentiality**—privilege is a legal protection in court proceedings, while confidentiality is an ethical (and sometimes legal) obligation in all professional contexts
- **Plan ahead for service interruptions** with professional wills and coverage arrangements
- **Only share information** that's necessary and relevant to the purpose of disclosure

These standards form the backbone of ethical practice. They're not just rules to memorize for the EPPP—they're the framework that will guide thousands of decisions throughout your career. Master them now, and you'll navigate ethical dilemmas with confidence later.
