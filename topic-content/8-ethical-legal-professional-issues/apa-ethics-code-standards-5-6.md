## Why These Standards Matter: Your Professional Reputation on the Line

Imagine posting on social media that you're a "certified relationship expert" when your only credential is a weekend workshop, or refusing to give a client their treatment records because they still owe you money. These might seem like gray areas, but they're actually clear ethical violations that could cost you your license. Standards 5 and 6 of the APA Ethics Code govern how you present yourself to the world and how you handle the business side of psychology. Think of these standards as the rules of engagement for your professional presence and your financial relationships with clients.

These standards matter because they protect two things: your clients' welfare and your professional credibility. In an age where everyone can claim expertise online and where one Google search can make or break a practice, understanding these guidelines isn't just about passing the EPPP—it's about building a career that won't implode from preventable mistakes.

## Standard 5: Advertising and Public Statements

### The Core Principle: Truth in Marketing

Standard 5 is essentially consumer protection for mental health services. Just like food packaging has to list actual ingredients, your professional statements need to reflect reality. The foundation is simple: don't lie, mislead, or exaggerate about your qualifications, services, or what you can offer.

Think about how frustrating it is when you download an app based on amazing reviews, only to discover those reviews were fake. That's the kind of deception this standard prevents in psychology. Your clients are often vulnerable when they seek your services—they're not in the best position to fact-check your credentials while they're dealing with a mental health crisis.

### What Counts as a Public Statement?

Public statements cover more territory than you might think. These include:

- Advertisements (online, print, radio, TV)
- Your website and social media profiles
- Directory listings (Psychology Today, insurance panels)
- Licensing applications and resumes
- Professional lectures and presentations
- Media interviews and articles

Basically, if someone outside your immediate family might see it, it's a public statement.

### The Credentials Rule: Not All Degrees Are Created Equal

Here's where things get specific. Standard 5.01 states that you can only claim degrees as credentials for mental health services if they meet one of two criteria:

1. A doctoral degree in psychology from a regionally accredited institution
2. A degree from a non-accredited program that your state specifically approved as qualifying you for licensure

This means your master's degree in counseling from an online program, while potentially valuable, can't be used to advertise psychology services unless your state has specifically approved it for licensure. It's like having a driver's license from another country—it might prove you can drive, but it doesn't necessarily qualify you to drive legally where you are now.

### When Others Speak for You

If you hire someone to manage your marketing—say, a social media manager or a PR firm—you're responsible for what they say about you. It's like being accountable for what your auto-reply email says. You can't claim ignorance just because someone else hit "send."

Standard 5.02 also covers media relationships. You can't pay a journalist or radio producer to feature you in what looks like a news story. That would be like an influencer posting an ad but pretending it's a genuine recommendation. If you're paying for exposure, it needs to be clearly labeled as a paid advertisement.

### The Media Expert Problem

Let's say a local news station asks you to comment on a trending mental health topic, or you start a TikTok account offering psychology tips. Standard 5.04 requires that your statements be based on your actual training and expertise. You can't give advice about eating disorders if your specialty is organizational psychology, just because someone asked.

More importantly, you need to make crystal clear that your media interactions don't create a therapist-client relationship. Imagine someone watches your YouTube video about anxiety and assumes you're now their therapist. The standard requires you to prevent this misunderstanding. This might mean including disclaimers like "This content is educational and does not replace professional treatment" in your videos or posts.

### Testimonials: The Vulnerability Factor

Standard 5.05 prohibits asking your current clients for testimonials. Period. It also prohibits soliciting testimonials from people who are vulnerable to your influence because of their circumstances.

Why the hard line? Think about the power dynamic involved. You're someone your client trusts with their deepest fears and insecurities. Asking them for a public endorsement puts them in an uncomfortable position—they might worry that refusing could affect their treatment or disappoint you. It's similar to a professor asking students for positive course reviews before grades are submitted. The power imbalance makes true consent impossible.

The "vulnerability" clause extends beyond current clients. Don't ask former clients for testimonials if they might return for services later, or people in crisis who contacted you but didn't continue treatment.

### In-Person Solicitation: The Ambulance Chaser Rule

Standard 5.06 is psychology's version of the rule against ambulance-chasing lawyers. You can't approach potential clients in person to drum up business, especially when they're vulnerable.

Picture this scenario: You're at a coffee shop and overhear someone talking about their recent divorce and depression. Standard 5.06 means you can't walk over, hand them your business card, and suggest they book a therapy session. That person is potentially vulnerable, and your unexpected approach could feel predatory.

However, there are important exceptions:

- **Family therapy recruitment**: You can absolutely encourage family members to participate in therapy when it benefits your current client
- **Disaster response**: After a community crisis, you can offer services proactively
- **Community outreach**: Educational presentations and health fairs are fine

The key difference? In acceptable situations, you're either helping an existing client or responding to a community need, not hunting for individual business opportunities.

## Standard 6: Record Keeping and Fees

### Why Records Matter More Than You Think

Medical professionals keep detailed records for good reasons—they're essential for continuity of care, legal protection, and ensuring quality treatment. In psychology, records serve the same purposes, but they also carry unique ethical weight because they contain highly sensitive information about people's thoughts, relationships, and vulnerabilities.

Standard 6.01 requires you to create, maintain, and dispose of records properly. Think of your records like a professional diary with consequences. They need to be detailed enough to be useful but protected enough to maintain confidentiality.

### Forensic Records: The Higher Standard

If you do forensic work—like custody evaluations, competency assessments, or expert testimony—your record-keeping standards are even stricter. Forensic records need to include everything you considered when forming your opinion: all your notes, the materials you reviewed, the tests you gave, even the scratch paper where you jotted down preliminary thoughts.

Why? Because in legal proceedings, the opposing attorney can request discovery of your entire file. Your records aren't just for your reference—they're potential evidence. It's like the difference between texting a friend versus sending an email at work. The work email assumes someone else might read it, so you're more careful.

### Digital Security: Protecting Records in the Modern Age

Standard 6.02(b) requires you to protect client information in databases and digital systems. In practice, this means:

- **Encryption**: All client records and communications should be encrypted, like putting sensitive documents in a locked safe rather than leaving them on your desk
- **HIPAA-compliant services**: Use cloud storage and communication platforms that meet federal privacy standards
- **Two-factor authentication**: Like requiring both a key and a code to open a safe
- **Air-gapped computers**: For highly sensitive work, use computers that aren't connected to the internet

You should also discuss digital risks with clients during informed consent. It's similar to how your doctor explains the risks of a procedure—clients deserve to know how their information is stored and transmitted.

### Planning for the Unexpected: The Professional Will

Standard 6.02(c) requires you to have a plan for maintaining confidentiality if you suddenly can't practice—whether due to retirement, disability, death, or emergency. This is your professional will.

Think about what would happen if you got hit by a bus tomorrow (morbid, but necessary to consider). Who would contact your clients? Who would secure your records? Who would handle ongoing cases? Without a plan, your spouse or executor might unknowingly violate confidentiality or leave clients in crisis without information about their treatment.

Practical steps include:

- Arranging with a colleague to manage your practice in emergencies
- Instructing a family member or executor on how to contact your professional network
- Documenting your wishes in a written agreement

### How Long to Keep Records

The APA Record Keeping Guidelines recommend keeping full adult records for at least seven years after the last service date. For minors, keep records until three years after they reach the age of majority, whichever is later.

These are minimums, not maximums. Many states require longer retention periods, and some situations warrant keeping records indefinitely. For example, if you did a custody evaluation that could be relevant to future legal proceedings, keeping those records longer protects both you and your client.

## The Money Conversation: Fees and Financial Arrangements

### Early and Often: Discussing Fees

Standard 6.04 requires you to discuss fees "as early as feasible" in the professional relationship. This isn't just good ethics—it's good business practice that prevents awkward surprises later.

Think about going on a first date where the other person orders expensive wine and appetizers, then announces they expect you to split the bill. That uncomfortable moment is what you're preventing by being upfront about costs.

Your fee discussion should cover:

| Topic | What to Address |
|-------|----------------|
| Session fees | Cost per session type (individual, family, group) |
| Billing schedule | When and how you bill (after each session, monthly) |
| Payment expectations | When payment is due, accepted methods |
| Missed appointments | Your cancellation policy and charges |
| Insurance | What's covered, co-pays, what happens if coverage ends |
| Unpaid fees | Your collection policy |

### The Collection Agency Warning

If a client doesn't pay, you can use collection agencies or legal action, but Standard 6.04(e) requires you to warn them first and give them a chance to pay promptly. This is like the final notice before your gym membership gets sent to collections—you deserve warning before things escalate.

When you do use a collection agency, share only the minimum necessary information: name, contact information, service dates, and amount owed. Don't disclose the nature of the services or any clinical information.

### Emergency Records and Unpaid Fees

Here's a critical distinction: Standard 6.03 prohibits withholding records needed for a client's emergency treatment just because they haven't paid. If your former client ends up in the emergency room with a mental health crisis, you can't refuse to share treatment records because they owe you money.

However, note that this protection applies specifically to emergency treatment records, not other situations. Also be aware that HIPAA actually goes further—it prohibits refusing to let patients inspect or copy their health records for any nonpayment reason.

### Sliding Scales: The Unwritten Rule

The Ethics Code doesn't specifically address sliding fee scales based on income, but they're generally considered acceptable when applied consistently and equitably. Think of it like tiered pricing for a streaming service—different people pay different amounts based on their circumstances, but the rules are applied fairly to everyone.

The key is consistency. You can't charge wealthy clients full price while giving discounts to people you personally like. That would be discrimination disguised as generosity.

### The Free First Session Debate

Some therapists offer a free initial consultation. The Ethics Code doesn't prohibit this, but there's debate about whether it's wise. The concern is that it might blur boundaries or create confusion about the professional relationship.

If you do offer free consultations, take precautions:

- Clearly explain the session's limited purpose (helping them decide if you're a good fit)
- Communicate the regular fee before the session happens
- Don't provide therapy during the free session—keep it consultative

### Barter: Proceed with Extreme Caution

Standard 6.05 says bartering goods or services for therapy can be acceptable if it's not clinically harmful or exploitative. However, most experts strongly discourage it because the risks usually outweigh the benefits.

Imagine accepting landscaping services from a client in exchange for therapy. What happens when you're dissatisfied with their work? What if the value of the services becomes unequal over time? What if they feel obligated to provide better services than they would for other customers? The potential for exploitation and boundary violations is enormous.

If you do consider bartering, trading goods (like artwork) is generally less risky than trading services, but it's still complicated.

### Accurate Billing: Don't Commit Fraud

Standard 6.06 requires accurate information to insurance companies about diagnosis, services provided, and fees charged. This seems obvious, but people violate it in surprisingly common ways:

**Unethical and Illegal Billing Practices:**

- Assigning an inaccurate diagnosis to get insurance coverage
- Billing under the psychologist's name when a supervisee provided the services
- Billing for individual therapy when you provided family or group therapy
- Billing for missed appointments without insurance approval
- Routinely waiving co-payments without the insurer's agreement

Each of these is fraud. It's not a gray area or a workaround—it's a crime that could cost you your license and potentially land you in jail.

### Referral Fees: Pay for Work, Not for Names

Standard 6.07 prohibits paying for referrals themselves but allows paying for actual services related to a referral. This distinction is like the difference between paying a recruiter a commission just for sending you a resume versus paying them for the hours they spent screening candidates and coordinating interviews.

You can pay a colleague for time spent discussing the client with you and preparing records to transfer. You can't pay them just for sending the client your way.

This rule doesn't prohibit:

- Paying psychology referral services their standard fees
- Fee-splitting when you and another professional both provided services
- Paying employees a percentage of fees as part of their compensation structure

### Forensic Fees: No Contingencies

The Guidelines for Forensic Psychology specifically discourage contingent fees (where you only get paid if your client "wins"). This makes sense—your impartiality would be compromised if your income depended on the outcome of the case. It's like paying a referee only if the home team wins. The conflict of interest is obvious.

## Common Misconceptions

**Misconception 1**: "I can mention my master's degree in my advertising because I earned it."

**Reality**: You can only use degrees as credentials for mental health services if they meet specific criteria. Your master's degree might be mentioned as part of your background, but not as a primary credential unless it qualified you for licensure.

**Misconception 2**: "Former clients can give me testimonials since they're not current clients anymore."

**Reality**: The vulnerability factor extends beyond current treatment. If they might return for services or are still in a vulnerable position related to their treatment, asking for testimonials is problematic.

**Misconception 3**: "I can withhold records until someone pays their bill."

**Reality**: You cannot withhold records needed for emergency treatment, and HIPAA prevents withholding records for inspection or copying for any nonpayment reason.

**Misconception 4**: "If my marketing company says something inaccurate about my practice, that's their fault, not mine."

**Reality**: You're responsible for statements made on your behalf by people or companies you've hired.

**Misconception 5**: "Bartering is unethical."

**Reality**: Bartering isn't automatically unethical, but it's risky and usually inadvisable. The Ethics Code allows it when it's not exploitative or harmful.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**The "Public Forever" Rule**: Treat every professional statement as if it will be printed on a billboard. If you wouldn't want it displayed publicly forever, don't say it.

**The Vulnerability Test**: Before soliciting testimonials or business, ask yourself: "Is this person in a position where they might feel they can't say no to me?" If yes, don't ask.

**The Paper Trail Principle**: Document everything about money discussions in writing. Your future self (possibly in a licensing board hearing) will thank you.

**The Emergency Exception**: Remember that emergency treatment needs trump financial concerns. If there's a crisis, provide necessary records.

**The Fraud Formula**: If you're changing information to get paid, you're committing fraud. Keep this simple and absolute in your mind.

## Key Takeaways

- Public statements must be truthful, non-deceptive, and based on actual qualifications from accredited programs or state-approved licensure programs
- You're responsible for statements made by anyone you hire to promote your practice
- Media comments must be based on your professional expertise and shouldn't create the impression of a therapist-client relationship
- Never solicit testimonials from current clients or vulnerable individuals
- Don't approach potential clients in person for business unless you're responding to disaster/community needs or helping current clients
- Maintain detailed, secure records with plans for confidential transfer if you can't continue practice
- Keep adult records for at least seven years; minor records until three years after they reach majority age
- Discuss fees early, clearly, and comprehensively
- Warn clients before sending unpaid accounts to collections
- Don't withhold records needed for emergency treatment due to unpaid fees
- Bartering is risky and generally discouraged, even though not prohibited
- Bill insurance companies accurately—inaccurate billing is fraud
- Pay colleagues for referral-related work, not just for sending clients your way
