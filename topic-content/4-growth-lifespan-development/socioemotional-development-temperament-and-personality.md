## Why Understanding Temperament and Personality Development Matters for Your Practice

Picture this: You're sitting across from a frustrated mother who says, "I don't understand why my three-year-old is so different from my first child. With my daughter, bedtime was easy. With my son, it's a battle every single night." Or imagine working with a young adult who can't figure out why they feel anxious in social situations when their siblings are perfectly comfortable meeting new people. Understanding temperament and personality development gives you the framework to answer these questions—and that's exactly what makes this material essential for the EPPP.

This isn't just about memorizing developmental stages. You're learning how people become who they are, from infancy through late adulthood. These concepts show up everywhere in clinical practice, from understanding parent-child conflicts to explaining why career transitions hit some people harder than others. Let's break it down in a way that makes sense and sticks with you.

## What Temperament Actually Means

Think of temperament as your emotional operating system—the default settings you come with before life experience starts installing updates. It's "genetically based but environmentally influenced tendencies to respond in predictable ways to events." In other words, some people are wired to approach new situations with enthusiasm, while others naturally hang back and observe first. Neither is better or worse; they're just different starting points.

Here's the important part for the exam: temperament shows low to moderate stability over time, becoming more stable after age three. This means a shy two-year-old might not necessarily be a shy twenty-year-old, but the patterns become more predictable as children develop. It's like how your smartphone gets more consistent in performance after the initial setup period.

## Three Major Approaches to Understanding Temperament

### Thomas and Chess: The Three Types Framework

Thomas and Chess gave us a practical way to categorize infant temperament based on nine dimensions like activity level, adaptability, and intensity of reaction. From these dimensions, they identified three main groups:

**Easy children** (about 40% of infants) are like that coworker who rolls with schedule changes and stays positive when projects shift direction. They adapt quickly to new situations, maintain regular sleep and eating patterns, and generally have a positive mood. These are the babies who transition smoothly between caregivers and adjust well to daycare.

**Slow-to-warm-up children** (about 15% of infants) need time to process changes. They're the employees who prefer advance notice before meetings and need a few moments to settle into new environments. They have mildly negative initial reactions to new situations but eventually adapt. Think of someone who's cautious about trying a new restaurant but enjoys it once they're there.

**Difficult children** (about 10% of infants) have intense reactions, irregular patterns, and respond negatively to new situations. They're not "bad" children—they just experience the world more intensely. Imagine someone who feels emotions at full volume while others experience them at medium levels.

Here's what matters for clinical work: Thomas and Chess's **goodness-of-fit model** explains that outcomes depend on the match between a child's temperament and their environment's demands. A difficult child with patient, consistent parents who allow gradual adaptation can develop just as well as an easy child. It's like matching your communication style to your audience—success comes from the fit, not from one style being universally better.

### Rothbart: Reactivity and Self-Regulation

Rothbart's approach gets more specific about the mechanisms behind temperament. She focuses on two main components:

**Reactivity** describes how your biological systems respond to stimulation—how quickly, how intensely, and for how long. This includes two factors:

- *Surgency/extraversion*: High activity levels, intense pleasure-seeking, low shyness. These are the people who get energized at networking events.
- *Negative affectivity*: Tendency toward sadness, fear, irritability, and mood instability. Think of someone whose emotional weather changes quickly.

**Self-regulation** (called effortful control) is your ability to override automatic responses to do what the situation requires instead. It's like when you're exhausted after a long day but push through to finish an important deadline, or when you're anxious about presenting but do it anyway because it's part of your job.

For the exam, remember that Rothbart developed questionnaires used across the lifespan to assess these temperament dimensions. Her work shows that temperament isn't just about infants—these patterns persist and evolve throughout life.

### Kagan: Behavioral Inhibition

Kagan zeroed in on one specific temperament trait: **behavioral inhibition (BI)**—the tendency to respond to unfamiliar people and situations with fear, withdrawal, and negative emotions. About 15-20% of children show high behavioral inhibition.

This matters clinically because high BI predicts increased risk for anxiety disorders (especially social anxiety), depression, and social functioning difficulties. Studies found that parents of highly inhibited children often had childhood anxiety disorders themselves. If you're assessing a client with social anxiety, understanding their temperamental history provides important context.

The research shows both continuity and discontinuity—meaning some highly inhibited children stay that way, while others don't. The continuity is stronger for those with very high levels of inhibition. It's like having a strong predisposition that can be amplified or softened by life experiences.

## From Temperament to Personality: The Classic Theories

### Freud vs. Erikson: Two Paths to Understanding Development

You need to know both theories for the exam, so here's the comparison that makes them easier to remember:

| Age | Freud's Psychosexual Stages | Erikson's Psychosocial Stages | Erikson's Virtue (If Successful) |
|-----|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Birth-1 year | Oral | Trust vs. Mistrust | Hope |
| 1-3 years | Anal | Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt | Will |
| 3-6 years | Phallic | Initiative vs. Guilt | Purpose |
| 6-12 years | Latency | Industry vs. Inferiority | Competence |
| Adolescence | Genital | Identity vs. Role Confusion | Fidelity |
| Young adulthood | — | Intimacy vs. Isolation | Love |
| Middle adulthood | — | Generativity vs. Stagnation | Care |
| Late adulthood | — | Integrity vs. Despair | Wisdom |

**Freud's psychosexual theory** focuses on how libido (sexual energy) concentrates in different body areas during development. He believed that too much or too little gratification at any stage causes fixation, affecting adult personality. For example, oral fixation from the first year might show up as excessive dependency or smoking in adulthood.

**Erikson's psychosocial theory** emphasizes social and cultural influences instead of sexual energy. Each stage presents a crisis to resolve, and better resolution leads to better outcomes. Unlike Freud, Erikson saw development continuing throughout life—which makes more intuitive sense when you consider how much people change through career shifts, parenthood, and aging.

For the exam, memorize both sets of stage names and ages, but focus extra attention on Erikson's virtues (the positive outcomes of each stage). Questions often ask about what develops from successfully resolving each crisis.

## How Parenting Shapes Personality and Behavior

Baumrind's parenting styles remain one of the most clinically useful frameworks you'll learn. They're based on two dimensions: **demandingness** (control, having rules) and **responsiveness** (warmth, acceptance). Understanding these helps you assess family dynamics and explain behavioral patterns.

### The Four Parenting Styles

| Parenting Style | Demandingness | Responsiveness | Child Outcomes |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Authoritative | High | High | Best outcomes: confident, independent, cooperative, good social skills |
| Authoritarian | High | Low | Insecure, moody, dependent, poor social skills, lower achievement |
| Permissive | Low | High | Self-centered, immature, rebellious, poor impulse control |
| Uninvolved/Neglectful | Low | Low | Worst outcomes: low self-esteem, poor self-control, moody, prone to substance use and antisocial behavior |

**Authoritative parents** set clear boundaries but respect their kids' input. They're warm and encourage independence. Think of a manager who has clear expectations but values team input and supports professional growth. Children raised this way typically show the best outcomes—but there's a cultural caveat. The positive impact on academic achievement is stronger for European American students than for Asian American and African American students, suggesting cultural context matters.

**Authoritarian parents** enforce strict rules with little warmth or flexibility. They emphasize obedience over independence. Research links this style (and the related concept of harsh parenting) to increased risk for both bullying others and externalizing behaviors (aggression, defiance) that persist into adulthood.

**Permissive parents** provide lots of warmth but few boundaries. They accept almost any behavior, even aggression. Their children tend to struggle with self-control and are more likely to be victimized by bullies than to bully others.

**Uninvolved/neglectful parents** provide neither structure nor warmth. They're checked out from their children's lives, more focused on their own needs. This style predicts the worst outcomes and is most strongly associated with juvenile delinquency—even more than authoritarian parenting.

When working with families, these styles give you a framework for understanding parent-child dynamics and suggesting modifications that improve fit and outcomes.

## Personality Changes Across Adulthood

Here's something that surprises many students: personality isn't fixed after adolescence. While there's high **rank-order stability** (meaning if you're more extraverted than your peers at 20, you'll likely still be more extraverted than them at 40), there are predictable **mean-level changes** in specific traits.

For the Big Five personality traits, research consistently finds:

- **Neuroticism decreases**: People generally become more emotionally stable with age
- **Extraversion and openness** remain stable or slightly decrease
- **Agreeableness increases**: People become more cooperative and compassionate
- **Conscientiousness increases**: People become more organized and responsible

These changes make intuitive sense. Most people in their twenties are navigating identity questions and emotional intensity. By their forties, they've usually settled into patterns that work for them. It's not that older adults are boring—they've just figured out what matters and developed better emotional regulation.

Regarding sex differences, research finds relatively small but consistent patterns across cultures (especially individualistic ones): Women tend to score higher on neuroticism, agreeableness, warmth, and openness to feelings. Men tend to score higher on assertiveness and openness to ideas. Remember these differences are averages with lots of individual variation—they describe group tendencies, not individual destinies.

## Self-Awareness and Identity Development

### When Self-Awareness Emerges

Self-awareness—recognizing yourself as a distinct individual separate from others—typically develops between 18-24 months. The **mirror self-recognition test** demonstrates this: researchers secretly place a red spot on a child's nose, then put them in front of a mirror. Children who touch their own nose (not the mirror) pass the test, showing they recognize the reflection as themselves.

Children with developmental delays (Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorder) pass this test later, around the cognitive developmental age when typically developing children pass it. This isn't about chronological age—it's about reaching the cognitive capacity for self-recognition.

Why does this matter? Mirror self-recognition is a prerequisite for **secondary emotions** like embarrassment, envy, and empathy. You can't feel embarrassed unless you first recognize yourself as a separate being who can be observed by others.

### How Self-Understanding Changes

Self-understanding evolves predictably through childhood and adolescence:

**Early childhood (2-6 years)**: Kids describe themselves using concrete, observable characteristics. "I'm five years old. I have brown hair. I like pizza." Gender and age come first, followed by physical traits and activities.

**Middle childhood (7-11 years)**: Descriptions become more general and comparative. "I'm good at soccer. I'm better at math than my friends. I'm a truthful person." They're developing trait labels and using social comparisons.

**Adolescence (12-18 years)**: Descriptions shift to abstract qualities, beliefs, and values. "I believe in social justice. I'm usually confident but sometimes doubt myself." They recognize their characteristics can vary by context—extraverted with friends, introverted with strangers.

This progression mirrors cognitive development. As thinking becomes more abstract and complex, so does self-understanding.

## Gender Identity Development: Four Key Theories

Gender identity development is a frequent EPPP topic, so understand what makes each theory distinct:

### Kohlberg's Cognitive Developmental Theory

Based on Piaget's work, Kohlberg argued that gender identity depends on cognitive development and unfolds in three stages:

1. **Gender identity (2-3 years)**: Children recognize themselves and others as male or female
2. **Gender stability (around age 4)**: Children understand gender is stable over time (boys become men, girls become women)
3. **Gender constancy (6-7 years)**: Children grasp that gender doesn't change with appearance or behavior

Kohlberg predicted children wouldn't adopt gender-typed behaviors until achieving gender constancy—but research showed kids prefer same-gender activities much earlier. This limitation led to other theories.

### Social Learning Theory

This approach (including Bandura's social cognitive version) says social factors drive gender identity development. Children observe and imitate same-gender models and receive reinforcement for gender-appropriate behaviors. Unlike Kohlberg, this theory proposes that gender-typed behavior comes *before* gender-related beliefs.

### Bem's Gender Schema Theory

Bem combined cognitive and social approaches, proposing that children organize gender-typed information into schemas (mental frameworks) they use to interpret the world. By age three, most kids have gender schemas for toys (trucks for boys, dolls for girls), with boys more resistant to cross-gender toys.

Bem distinguished between **gender-schematic** people (for whom gender is very important in organizing information and guiding behavior) and **gender-aschematic** people (who are less influenced by gender norms). She developed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) to measure gender identity across four categories: feminine, masculine, androgynous, and undifferentiated.

### Egan and Perry's Multidimensional Model

Unlike the developmental theories, this model identifies components of gender identity:

- **Membership knowledge**: Knowing your own gender
- **Gender typicality**: How similar you feel to others of your gender
- **Gender contentedness**: Satisfaction with your gender
- **Felt pressure**: Pressure to conform to gender norms
- **Intergroup bias**: Believing your gender is superior

Research finds that high typicality and contentedness predict positive outcomes (high self-esteem, peer acceptance), while high felt pressure predicts adjustment problems.

### Psychological Androgyny

Bem's research on androgyny (having both high masculine and high feminine traits) suggested it's advantageous because it provides more behavioral flexibility. Studies confirm androgynous individuals adapt better to different situations and that androgynous children often have higher self-esteem. However, some research suggests that masculine traits specifically (rather than androgyny) drive these benefits. The findings aren't entirely consistent, so focus on knowing the basic concepts for the exam.

## Marcia's Identity Statuses in Adolescence

Marcia extended Erikson's identity vs. role confusion stage by identifying four identity statuses based on whether someone has experienced an **identity crisis** (exploration of options) and made an **identity commitment** (chosen a path):

| Identity Status | Crisis? | Commitment? | Description |
|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Identity Diffusion | No | No | No exploration, no commitment; going with the flow |
| Identity Foreclosure | No | Yes | Committed without exploration; accepting others' choices |
| Identity Moratorium | Yes | No | Currently exploring; hasn't committed yet |
| Identity Achievement | Yes | Yes | Has explored and made commitments |

**Identity diffusion**: "I haven't really thought about my career or values." No exploration, no commitment. Just drifting.

**Identity foreclosure**: "I'm going to medical school like my parents expect." Strong commitment but no personal exploration—accepting what authority figures want.

**Identity moratorium**: "I'm taking a gap year to figure out what I really want." Active exploration without commitment yet.

**Identity achievement**: "After trying different paths, I've decided to become a therapist." Has explored and committed based on that exploration.

Important for the exam: Identity formation happens at different rates for different life domains (career, politics, religion), and people can recycle through moratorium and achievement during adulthood. It's not a one-and-done process.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Temperament is destiny"**: Wrong. Temperament provides a starting point, but goodness-of-fit with environment matters enormously. A difficult temperament doesn't doom a child to problems if parents provide appropriate support.

**"Freud's stages end personality development"**: Nope. Erikson's model (which extends through life) is more accurate. Personality development continues across the lifespan with predictable changes in adulthood.

**"Authoritarian and authoritative are basically the same"**: This confusion is deadly on the exam. Authoritarian is high control with low warmth. Authoritative is high control with high warmth. The outcomes are dramatically different.

**"Gender constancy comes first, then gender-typed behavior"**: Kohlberg predicted this, but research showed the opposite—kids show gender-typed preferences before achieving gender constancy.

**"Once you achieve identity, you're done"**: Marcia's research shows people recycle through identity statuses across adulthood as life circumstances change.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For parenting styles**, remember: **"Authority needs warmth"**—authoritative has both authority (demandingness) and warmth (responsiveness), producing the best outcomes.

**For Freud vs. Erikson stages**, create a table and quiz yourself repeatedly. The ages and stage names are high-yield exam material. Focus especially on Erikson's virtues.

**For temperament theorists**, use initials: **TCR-K** (Thomas/Chess = Three types, Rothbart = Reactivity/regulation, Kagan = behavioral inhibition).

**For Marcia's statuses**, think about people you know: Who's in moratorium exploring options? Who foreclosed by following family expectations? This makes abstract concepts concrete.

**For Big Five changes in adulthood**, remember: **"OCEAN gets calmer"**—Openness stable/decreases, Conscientiousness increases, Extraversion stable/decreases, Agreeableness increases, Neuroticism decreases.

## Key Takeaways

- **Temperament** is your biological starting point—genetic but environmentally influenced—becoming more stable after age three
- **Thomas and Chess** identified easy, slow-to-warm-up, and difficult temperaments; their goodness-of-fit model emphasizes environment match over temperament type
- **Rothbart** focuses on reactivity (surgency/extraversion and negative affectivity) and self-regulation (effortful control)
- **Kagan's behavioral inhibition** predicts social anxiety and other difficulties, especially when highly stable
- **Freud's psychosexual stages** end in adolescence; **Erikson's psychosocial stages** continue throughout life with specific virtues at each stage
- **Authoritative parenting** (high demandingness + high responsiveness) produces the best outcomes; **uninvolved parenting** produces the worst
- **Personality in adulthood** shows high rank-order stability but predictable mean-level changes: neuroticism decreases, agreeableness and conscientiousness increase
- **Self-awareness** emerges at 18-24 months (mirror test); self-understanding becomes more abstract and complex through childhood and adolescence
- **Gender identity theories**: Kohlberg emphasizes cognition, social learning emphasizes observation/reinforcement, Bem combines both in schema theory, Egan/Perry identifies components
- **Marcia's identity statuses** combine crisis (exploration) and commitment: diffusion (neither), foreclosure (commitment without exploration), moratorium (exploring), achievement (both)

Understanding these concepts gives you the foundation to assess developmental concerns, explain behavioral patterns, and guide interventions across the lifespan. These aren't just exam topics—they're tools you'll use every day in practice.
