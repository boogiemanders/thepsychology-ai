## Why Your Netflix Choices Say More Than You Think: Understanding Attitudes and Attitude Change

You've probably noticed something strange: your friend Sarah posts constantly about climate change on social media, but she just bought an SUV and takes weekend flights to Vegas. Meanwhile, your coworker Mike swears he hates reality TV, yet you spotted "Love Island" in his recently watched list. What's going on here? Why don't people's stated beliefs always match their actions?

This disconnect between what we say we believe and what we actually do sits at the heart of attitude research—and it's one of the most tested topics on the EPPP. Understanding attitudes and how they change matters not just for the exam, but for your future practice. Whether you're helping clients change health behaviors, working with families in conflict, or designing intervention programs, you need to know when attitudes predict behavior and when they don't.

## The Attitude-Behavior Gap: It's Complicated

Early psychologists were frustrated to discover that attitudes don't predict behavior as well as they expected. Imagine conducting a survey asking people if they support environmental protection, getting overwhelmingly positive responses, then watching those same people ignore the recycling bin right next to the trash can. This happened so often in research that scientists almost gave up on attitudes entirely.

But then they discovered something important: the relationship isn't weak—it's just conditional. Think of attitudes like your phone's GPS signal. Sometimes it works perfectly, giving you accurate directions. Other times, it's spotty or completely off. The question isn't whether GPS works, but under what conditions it works best.

### Three Conditions That Make Attitudes Predict Behavior

**Strength**: Your attitude needs to be strong, not lukewarm. You developed strong attitudes through direct experience or when the issue hits close to home. Someone who grew up with a parent suffering from alcoholism will have stronger attitudes about drinking than someone who just read an article about it. That person's attitude will better predict their actual behavior around alcohol—whether they avoid bars, speak up when friends drink too much, or pursue careers in addiction counseling.

**Accessibility**: Your attitude needs to be easily retrievable from memory. This happens when you're well-informed about something or you've been asked about it repeatedly. Think about your attitude toward the last presidential election versus your attitude toward local water regulation policy. You probably have an immediately accessible opinion about the election (you discussed it at dinner parties, saw endless news coverage), but you might need to think hard about water policy. Your voting behavior will better match your easily accessible attitudes.

**Specificity**: Your attitudes and the behaviors you're predicting need to match in specificity. This is where early research went wrong. It's like asking someone if they "like exercise" (general attitude) and then trying to predict whether they'll attend a 6 AM spin class on Tuesday mornings (specific behavior). Of course that doesn't work well. But asking about attitudes toward early morning spin classes specifically? That's a better match.

## Three Models That Explain When Attitudes Lead to Action

### Theory of Planned Behavior: The Intention GPS

According to this model, your intention to do something is the best predictor of whether you'll actually do it. But what determines your intention? Three factors work together like a GPS navigation system:

1. **Your attitude toward the behavior**: Do you personally think it's good or bad?
2. **Subjective norms**: What do you think important people in your life expect you to do?
3. **Perceived behavioral control**: Do you believe you can actually pull it off?

Let's say you're deciding whether to start therapy yourself (something many psychology students consider). You might personally value therapy (positive attitude), believe your graduate program encourages it (subjective norm), and feel confident you can afford it and find time (perceived control). With all three factors aligned, you'll likely form a strong intention—and actually follow through.

But remove one factor: maybe you worry your partner thinks therapy is "only for people with serious problems" (negative subjective norm). Suddenly your intention weakens, even though your personal attitude and confidence remain high.

### Prototype/Willingness Model: The Social Situation Wild Card

This model introduces something important: not all behaviors are carefully planned. Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we make spontaneous decisions based on social factors.

The model describes two paths to behavior:

**The Reasoned Path**: This works like the Theory of Planned Behavior—you think it through and form intentions.

**The Social Reaction Path**: This is about willingness in the moment, based on your mental image (prototype) of the kind of person who does that behavior.

Here's how it plays out: Imagine you're at a professional conference. You didn't plan to drink much (reasoned path says "be professional"). But you're at a networking event, and you notice that the people you most want to connect with—successful, respected professionals—are having cocktails and seem relaxed and social. Your prototype of "people who have drinks at conferences" shifts from "unprofessional partiers" to "successful networkers." Your willingness to join them increases, even though your original intention was to stick with water.

This model is especially useful for understanding risk behaviors. Adolescents might not intend to try vaping, but if they have a positive image of peers who vape (seeing them as cool or confident), they become more willing to try it when offered in social situations.

### Health Belief Model: The Risk Calculator

This model specifically addresses health behaviors—which you'll encounter constantly in clinical practice. It identifies six factors that predict whether someone will take action to protect their health:

| Factor | Question It Answers | Example |
|--------|---------------------|---------|
| Perceived Susceptibility | "Could this happen to me?" | "I have a family history of diabetes, so I'm at real risk" |
| Perceived Severity | "How bad would it be?" | "Diabetes could mean losing my vision or needing amputations" |
| Perceived Benefits | "Will taking action actually help?" | "If I change my diet and exercise, I can significantly reduce my risk" |
| Perceived Barriers | "What's stopping me?" | "Eating healthy is expensive and time-consuming; the gym is intimidating" |
| Self-Efficacy | "Can I actually do this?" | "I've successfully changed habits before; I can learn to cook healthier meals" |
| Cues to Action | "What's the trigger?" | "My doctor's warning, my friend's diagnosis, that article I read" |

Think about a client dealing with anxiety who avoids seeking medication. They might see themselves as highly susceptible (they know they have anxiety), recognize the severity (it's affecting their job), and believe medication could help (perceived benefit). But if they see major barriers ("medication means I'm weak," "side effects scare me") or lack self-efficacy ("I'll just forget to take it"), they won't take action—no matter how much they intellectually understand the benefits.

As a future clinician, you can use this model diagnostically. When a client isn't following through on health recommendations, identify which factor is the sticking point. Low self-efficacy needs a different intervention than high perceived barriers.

## How Attitudes Actually Change: Five Major Theories

### Elaboration Likelihood Model: Two Roads to Persuasion

Imagine you're scrolling through your social media feed. A post about a new therapeutic approach appears. How you process that information depends on two possible routes:

**The Central Route** (the deep dive): You're in study mode, the topic matters for your upcoming exam, you're feeling focused. You read carefully, evaluate the evidence, compare it to what you already know, check the sources. The post convinces you because the arguments are strong. This attitude change is deep, lasting, and will influence how you actually practice.

**The Peripheral Route** (the quick glance): You're tired, scrolling mindlessly before bed. You don't really process the arguments, but you notice the post is from a celebrity psychologist you follow, it has thousands of likes, and there's an appealing infographic. You think, "Seems legit," and scroll on. If this changes your attitude at all, it's superficial and temporary.

What determines which route you take?

- **Relevance**: Is this about your area of specialization or something unrelated?
- **Ability**: Are you alert and knowledgeable enough to evaluate it?
- **Mood**: Surprisingly, good moods often lead to peripheral processing (you're less motivated to think hard), while neutral or slightly negative moods promote central processing

Here's the clinical application: When you're trying to change a client's attitude about something crucial (like the importance of trauma processing), you want central route processing. Make it personally relevant, ensure they have the cognitive capacity (not during a crisis), and present strong arguments. Don't rely on peripheral cues like your credentials or office decor—those produce weak, temporary change.

### Social Judgment Theory: The Latitude Lines

This theory introduces a spatial metaphor for attitudes. Imagine your position on any issue as a point on a map, with three zones radiating out:

**Latitude of Acceptance**: Positions close to yours that you find reasonable  
**Latitude of Noncommitment**: Positions different enough that you're unsure but willing to consider  
**Latitude of Rejection**: Positions so different from yours they seem ridiculous

Here's the key insight: persuasive messages that fall in your latitude of acceptance or noncommitment can change your mind. Messages in your latitude of rejection? They'll backfire, making you dig in harder.

Your ego-involvement (how personally important the issue is) changes the size of these zones. When something matters deeply to you, your acceptance zone shrinks to almost nothing, noncommitment disappears, and rejection expands enormously. You become nearly impossible to persuade.

Picture a client who's strongly against medication for psychological issues (high ego-involvement). If you come out strongly advocating for medication right away, you're landing in their massive rejection zone. They'll dismiss everything you say. But if you start by acknowledging concerns about medication, discussing lifestyle changes first, and gradually introducing medication as one option among many, you're working within their noncommitment zone. You have a chance.

This is why motivational interviewing works: it meets clients where they are, gently expanding their latitude of acceptance rather than crashing into their rejection zone.

### Balance Theory: The Relationship Triangle

This theory maps the relationships among three elements: You (P), another person (O), and an issue or thing (X). The theory says we're comfortable when these relationships are balanced and uncomfortable when they're unbalanced.

**Balanced state**: You like your colleague Josh, Josh loves cognitive behavioral therapy, and you also love CBT. Everything fits together comfortably.

**Unbalanced state**: You like your colleague Emily, Emily thinks psychoanalysis is outdated nonsense, but you're passionate about psychoanalytic approaches. This creates psychological tension.

What do you do with that tension? You have options:

- Change your attitude toward Emily (maybe she's not so great after all)
- Change your attitude toward psychoanalysis (maybe it is outdated)
- Downplay the importance of this disagreement (we can like each other despite professional differences)

Notice what this explains: why we tend to share attitudes with people we like, why couples often develop similar political views over time, and why you might find yourself questioning your own positions when someone you respect disagrees with you.

In clinical work, this matters for understanding clients' resistance. If a client strongly trusts you but you're recommending something they dislike, they're in an unbalanced state. They might change their attitude toward the intervention (good outcome), but they also might resolve the imbalance by trusting you less (bad outcome). Being aware of this helps you navigate recommendations more skillfully.

### Cognitive Dissonance Theory: The Mental Discomfort Motivator

This is probably the most famous attitude change theory, and for good reason—it explains so much of human behavior.

The core idea: when you become aware of inconsistency between your beliefs or between your beliefs and actions, you experience uncomfortable mental tension called cognitive dissonance. You're motivated to reduce that discomfort.

The classic experiment: Researchers had people do an incredibly boring task (turning pegs on a board for an hour). Then they paid participants either $1 or $20 to lie to the next participant, telling them the task was interesting. Later, participants rated how enjoyable the task actually was.

Logic would suggest people paid $20 would rate the task more favorably—they got paid more, so they should feel better about it. But the opposite happened. People paid $1 rated the boring task as more enjoyable.

Why? People paid $20 had sufficient justification for lying—"I lied for good money, but the task was still boring." No dissonance. But people paid $1 had insufficient justification. They experienced dissonance: "I lied (my behavior) even though I wasn't paid much, but I'm not a liar (my self-concept)." To reduce this discomfort, they changed their attitude: "Actually, the task wasn't that bad."

You see this everywhere in adult life:

- You bought an expensive car you can barely afford (behavior), but you believe you're financially responsible (belief). Dissonance. Solution: "This car will last forever and save money on repairs" (adding consonant cognitions).

- You stayed late at work again despite promising your partner you'd be home for dinner (behavior), but you value your relationship (belief). Dissonance. Solution: Either "This project is really crucial" (justifying behavior) or "I need better boundaries" (changing future behavior).

- A client continues an unhealthy relationship (behavior) while recognizing it's harmful (belief). Dissonance. They might minimize the harm ("It's not that bad"), blame external factors ("They're stressed"), or focus on positive aspects ("When it's good, it's really good").

Understanding cognitive dissonance helps you recognize why people rationalize, why change is hard even when people "know better," and why insufficient justification can paradoxically be more motivating than large rewards.

### Self-Perception Theory: We Watch Ourselves Too

This theory offers a different take: sometimes we don't have clear attitudes until we observe our own behavior, just like we observe others' behavior to understand them.

You might think you know whether you enjoy hiking. But if someone asks you and you haven't hiked in years, you might actually look at your behavior: "Well, I haven't gone hiking despite having opportunities, so I guess I don't enjoy it that much." You inferred your attitude from your actions.

The most important application is the **overjustification effect**: adding external rewards to intrinsically motivated behavior can actually reduce internal motivation.

The research: Children who enjoyed drawing were given gold star rewards for drawing. Later, when stars were no longer given, these children drew less than children who had never been rewarded. The external reward undermined their intrinsic enjoyment. They went from "I draw because I love it" to "I draw to get stars," and when stars disappeared, so did motivation.

This has huge implications for parenting, education, and therapy. If you're working with a client who exercises regularly for enjoyment, introducing external rewards ("I'll give you a prize if you exercise three times this week") might backfire. They might start attributing their exercise to the reward rather than internal motivation, and when rewards end, so does exercise.

The key: use external rewards carefully with intrinsically motivated behaviors. They work better for behaviors people aren't initially motivated to do.

## Common Misconceptions and Exam Traps

**Misconception 1**: "Attitudes always predict behavior."  
Reality: They predict behavior only under specific conditions (strong, accessible, matching specificity).

**Misconception 2**: "The central route is always better than the peripheral route."  
Reality: Both routes serve purposes. Quick decisions about unimportant matters (which coffee shop to try) can reasonably use peripheral cues. You can't deeply process everything.

**Misconception 3**: "Cognitive dissonance and self-perception theory contradict each other."  
Reality: They may explain different situations. Dissonance theory works best when attitudes are clear and behavior contradicts them. Self-perception theory works best when initial attitudes are weak or ambiguous.

**Misconception 4**: "The Health Belief Model says people need all six factors to change."  
Reality: These factors contribute probabilistically. Higher levels of multiple factors increase likelihood of behavior change, but there's no absolute threshold.

## Memory Strategies for the EPPP

**For Theory of Planned Behavior**, remember "A-SN-PBC" (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control). Think: "A Sunny Plan Brings Change" (you need the right attitude, social support, and confidence to change).

**For the Health Belief Model**, use "SSBB-SC": Susceptibility, Severity, Benefits, Barriers, Self-efficacy, Cues to action.

**To distinguish cognitive dissonance from self-perception theory**: Dissonance feels uncomfortable and motivating (like an alarm going off). Self-perception is cooler and more observational (like watching footage of yourself).

**For elaboration likelihood model**: Central route = thoughtful, lasting, based on argument strength. Peripheral route = superficial, temporary, based on surface cues. Remember: Your CENTRAL nervous system is deep and complex; your PERIPHERAL nervous system is on the surface.

**For social judgment theory**: Picture actual latitude lines on a globe—acceptance near the equator (your position), rejection at the poles (opposite position), noncommitment in between.

## Key Takeaways

- **Attitudes predict behavior best when they're strong, accessible, and match the behavior's specificity**. Weak or general attitudes are poor predictors.

- **Three models explain attitude-behavior links**: Theory of Planned Behavior (intention driven by attitude + norms + control), Prototype/Willingness Model (reasoned path + social reaction path), and Health Belief Model (six factors predicting health behavior).

- **The Elaboration Likelihood Model describes two processing routes**: Central (deep, thoughtful, lasting change) and peripheral (superficial, temporary, based on cues). Personal relevance, cognitive ability, and mood determine which route you take.

- **Social Judgment Theory explains that persuasion depends on how far a message is from your current position**: Messages in your latitude of acceptance or noncommitment can persuade you; messages in your rejection latitude backfire.

- **Balance Theory predicts you'll seek consistency** among your feelings toward a person, that person's views, and your own views—motivating attitude change to reduce imbalance.

- **Cognitive Dissonance Theory explains that inconsistency between cognitions or between cognitions and behavior creates discomfort**, motivating attitude change. Insufficient justification can produce more attitude change than large justification.

- **Self-Perception Theory suggests we infer our attitudes by observing our own behavior**. The overjustification effect shows that external rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation.

- **For clinical practice**: Use these theories to understand why clients resist change, design more effective interventions, and recognize that changing behavior sometimes precedes (and causes) attitude change, not just the other way around.
