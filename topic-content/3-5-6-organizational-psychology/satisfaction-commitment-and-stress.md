## Why This Topic Matters for Your Career (and Life)

You're working long hours studying for the EPPP while juggling a job, maybe a relationship, possibly a side hustle. Some days you wake up excited about your career path. Other days, you're updating your resume at midnight wondering if you should've become a yoga instructor instead. That internal experience—the satisfaction, the commitment, the stress—isn't just your personal drama. It's science, and understanding it will help you ace the exam AND make sense of your own professional journey.

This material spans multiple EPPP domains because workplace psychology touches everything from social behavior to cognitive functioning to individual differences. You'll see questions about organizational commitment, stress responses, and job satisfaction scattered throughout the test. More importantly, as a future psychologist, you'll counsel clients dealing with career stress, burnout, and work-life conflicts. Let's break down what really drives satisfaction, commitment, and stress in the workplace.

## Job Satisfaction: Why Some People Love Mondays

Job satisfaction is exactly what it sounds like—how content someone feels about their work. But here's the interesting part: it's surprisingly stable across time and different jobs. If you were generally satisfied as a barista, you'll probably be satisfied as a therapist. If you complained about your retail job, your psychology practice might not magically fix your attitude.

### What Makes Satisfaction Stick?

Three factors explain why satisfaction follows us around like a shadow:

**Self-esteem** acts like a filter for your entire work experience. People with higher self-esteem tend to interpret workplace events more positively. When your supervisor gives feedback, high self-esteem helps you hear "constructive growth opportunity" instead of "you're terrible at your job." The research shows that self-esteem correlates with both job satisfaction AND life satisfaction—they're connected vessels.

**Affective disposition** is your baseline emotional setting. Think of it like the default brightness on your phone screen. Some people have theirs set to "sunny outlook"—they respond favorably across different situations. Others default to "skeptical" or "pessimistic." This tendency shapes how you experience everything from team meetings to performance reviews. It's not about the specific job; it's about the lens you're looking through.

**Genetic predisposition** is the wild card. Arvey and colleagues studied identical twins who were separated at birth and raised in completely different environments. As adults, these twins showed similar levels of job satisfaction, suggesting about 30% of job satisfaction comes from your genetic makeup. You inherited your eye color, your height, and apparently some of your feelings about work. This doesn't mean satisfaction is unchangeable, but it does mean some baseline is baked in.

### Fairness: The Secret Ingredient

Organizational justice—how fair things feel at work—significantly impacts satisfaction. There are three types, and you need to know the distinctions:

| Type of Justice | What It Means | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Distributive | Fairness of outcomes (who gets what) | You and your colleague both worked overtime, but only they got a bonus |
| Procedural | Fairness of the process used to decide | Promotions are based on clear criteria vs. "who the boss likes" |
| Interactional | Fairness in how decisions are communicated | Your manager explains a pay freeze respectfully vs. sending a cold email |

Interactional justice breaks down further into **interpersonal** (how you're treated during interactions—with dignity or dismissal?) and **informational** (whether explanations are thorough or vague). All three types matter for satisfaction, though research hasn't crowned a clear winner for which matters most.

### Does Satisfaction Actually Matter?

Here's where students often expect a simple answer and get complicated reality instead. Job satisfaction correlates with several outcomes, but the relationships are more modest than you might think:

**Health effects**: Satisfaction relates to both psychological and physical health, with a stronger link to mental health. Think of satisfaction as a protective factor—not a guarantee, but it helps. Satisfied employees tend to live longer and report fewer health complaints.

**Performance**: This relationship is surprisingly weak. Early meta-analyses found correlations around .17 (basically, knowing someone's satisfaction tells you very little about their performance). A later, more rigorous analysis bumped it to .30—better, but still modest. The "happy worker is a productive worker" maxim is oversimplified.

Here's the twist: the relationship between satisfaction and performance gets stronger when pay directly links to performance. This suggests performance might cause satisfaction (through rewards) rather than satisfaction causing performance. When you perform well, you get reinforced, which makes you satisfied. It's the reinforcement doing the heavy lifting.

**Other outcomes**: Satisfaction relates to lower absenteeism and turnover, but again, correlations are moderate. Someone can be satisfied but still leave for a better opportunity, or be unsatisfied but stay because they need health insurance.

## Organizational Commitment: Why People Stay (or Leave)

While satisfaction is about liking your job, commitment is about attachment to the organization. You can enjoy your daily work but not feel particularly loyal to the company, or vice versa.

### Three Flavors of Commitment

Think of commitment as having three distinct motivations, each with different implications:

**Affective commitment** is emotional attachment. You stay because you WANT to—you identify with the organization's mission, you like your colleagues, you feel connected. This is the "we're like family here" feeling (when it's genuine, not just what they say during orientation). Of the three types, affective commitment shows the strongest and most consistent relationships with positive job outcomes.

**Continuance commitment** is staying because you NEED to. You've got a mortgage, your kids' tuition is due, and job hunting sounds exhausting. Or maybe your retirement is tied up in company stock that hasn't fully vested. This is the "golden handcuffs" scenario. People with high continuance commitment might not be happy, but they feel trapped by practical considerations.

**Normative commitment** is staying because you feel you SHOULD. Maybe the company paid for your graduate degree, so leaving feels disloyal. Or you were raised with values about not being a "job hopper." This is obligation-based attachment.

These types aren't mutually exclusive—you might have all three operating simultaneously at different levels. But affective commitment is the one organizations should aim for because it correlates most strongly with desirable outcomes like performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, and lower turnover intentions.

## Stress: When Your Body Treats Deadlines Like Predators

Stress happens when external demands push your physical or psychological functions beyond their comfortable range. Your body hasn't evolved much since humans lived in caves, so it treats a nasty email from your supervisor remarkably similar to how it treats a predator attack.

### The General Adaptation Syndrome: Your Body's Three-Act Stress Response

Selye described how we physically respond to stressors in three predictable stages:

**Stage 1: Alarm Reaction** – This is the immediate "oh no" response. Your hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which kicks off two simultaneous processes. First, it activates your sympathetic nervous system and signals your adrenal medulla to dump epinephrine and norepinephrine into your bloodstream. Second, it tells your pituitary gland to release ACTH, which then prompts your adrenal cortex to release cortisol. The result? Your heart races, your breathing quickens, glucose floods your system, and you're physically ready to fight or run. Your ancestors used this to escape lions. You use it to handle a surprise audit at work.

**Stage 2: Resistance** – If the stressor continues (your workload doesn't decrease, the difficult supervisor doesn't transfer), your body shifts to sustained coping mode. Some functions normalize, but cortisol stays elevated to maintain high energy availability. You're essentially running on premium fuel continuously. This works temporarily—you pull off the big project, you get through the crisis period.

**Stage 3: Exhaustion** – But bodies aren't meant to run in crisis mode indefinitely. Eventually, your pituitary and adrenal glands get tired. They can't maintain those elevated hormone levels, and systems start breaking down. This is when serious health consequences emerge.

### The Cost of Chronic Stress

Prolonged elevated cortisol creates a cascade of problems. Your immune system gets suppressed, making you more vulnerable to infections (which explains why you always catch a cold after finals week). Blood pressure stays elevated, increasing heart attack risk. Sleep suffers, digestion struggles, headaches multiply.

Perhaps most relevant for psychology students: chronic cortisol damages hippocampal cells. The hippocampus is critical for forming new long-term memories. Chronic stress literally makes it harder to learn and remember information—not great when you're preparing for a comprehensive exam.

### What Makes Work Stressful?

Three major sources of workplace stress repeatedly show up in research:

**Lack of control** is perhaps the most reliable predictor of stress. When you can't influence your schedule, your work pace, or how you accomplish tasks, stress skyrockets. Meta-analyses show that low perceived control relates to job dissatisfaction, reduced performance, emotional distress, and physical health problems. Research on factory workers found that those doing machine-paced work (where the assembly line dictates speed) had higher cortisol levels than those doing self-paced work. This explains why micromanagement feels so toxic—it strips away control.

**Work-family conflict** occurs when your work role and personal life role clash. You're missing your kid's recital because of a client emergency. You're distracted during supervision because your parent is sick. This conflict correlates with lower job and life satisfaction. Interestingly, men and women report similar overall levels of work-family conflict, though patterns differ slightly in dual-earner couples. Men report slightly more work-to-family interference (work bleeding into home), while women report slightly more family-to-work interference (home responsibilities affecting work). These differences are small, though, challenging assumptions about gendered stress patterns.

**Downsizing** creates stress for obvious reasons if you lose your job, but it also devastates survivors. Employees who keep their jobs often develop "survivor syndrome": reduced satisfaction and commitment, loss of control, physical symptoms, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and guilt. Why? The organization has violated the psychological contract—the unwritten understanding of what employee and employer owe each other. Even if nothing in your employment contract promised permanent employment, there was an implied mutual commitment. When the company breaks that, trust evaporates. Fair procedures and clear communication can reduce (though not eliminate) these effects.

## Burnout: When Stress Turns Chronic and Corrodes

Job burnout isn't just "really stressed." It's a specific syndrome resulting from chronic work stress that has three core characteristics:

**Exhaustion** is the depletion piece—emotional, physical, and mental resources feel drained. You're not just tired; you're empty.

**Depersonalization and cynicism** means you start treating clients, customers, or colleagues as objects rather than people. For therapists, this might look like viewing clients as annoying problems rather than suffering humans. You become detached, negative, and dismissive.

**Sense of inefficacy** is the feeling that nothing you do matters. Your efforts seem pointless, your work meaningless. Despite working hard, you feel ineffective.

An early warning sign is putting in more time and effort without seeing increased productivity—you're working harder but accomplishing less. This typically comes with irritability, negativity, social withdrawal, and physical symptoms.

Maslach identified six areas where person-environment mismatch increases burnout risk: workload (too much to do), control (too little autonomy), reward (insufficient recognition or compensation), community (poor relationships or conflict), fairness (perceived injustice), and values (ethical conflicts between personal and organizational values). The more mismatches, the higher the risk.

## Building Stress Resistance: Individual Factors That Help

Some people handle stress better than others. Three characteristics repeatedly show up in research on stress resistance:

**Hardiness** is a personality trait involving three elements: control (believing you can influence outcomes), commitment (finding meaning in work and relationships), and challenge (viewing difficulties as opportunities rather than threats). Hardy individuals don't experience less stress—they interpret and respond to it differently. They see stressors as problems to solve rather than catastrophes to endure. Research confirms hardiness correlates with better physical and mental health outcomes.

**Organization-based self-esteem (OBSE)** reflects how much you feel valued as an organization member. High OBSE acts as a buffer against stress—you're less affected by stressors and more active in coping with them. Low OBSE creates vulnerability; you're more reactive to stress and more passive in response. This connects to the self-esteem research on job satisfaction—your sense of worth shapes your entire work experience.

**Type A Behavior Pattern** is the opposite of protective. Friedman and Rosenman described it as chronic time urgency, excessive competitiveness, and hostility. While earlier research linked the entire pattern to coronary heart disease, more recent studies suggest hostility is the toxic component. The person who's driven and time-urgent but not hostile may not face elevated heart disease risk. But the hostile, cynical person—regardless of time urgency—shows increased cardiovascular problems.

## Common Misconceptions That Trip Up Test-Takers

**Misconception 1**: "High job satisfaction always leads to high performance."
Reality: The correlation is modest (.30 at best) and may run the opposite direction—performance leads to satisfaction through rewards.

**Misconception 2**: "Genetic factors determining 30% of job satisfaction means nothing can change it."
Reality: 30% genetic influence means 70% comes from other factors. Satisfaction isn't fixed; it just has a baseline starting point.

**Misconception 3**: "All stress is bad and should be eliminated."
Reality: The GAS describes response to stress, not inherently harmful stress. Brief stressors can be manageable or even motivating. It's chronic, uncontrollable stress that creates health problems.

**Misconception 4**: "Women experience more work-family conflict than men."
Reality: Overall levels are similar. Patterns differ slightly in specific situations, but the general experience is comparable.

**Misconception 5**: "Burnout is just extreme stress."
Reality: Burnout is a specific syndrome with three components (exhaustion, depersonalization, inefficacy) resulting from chronic work stress. Not all stressed people are burned out.

## Memory Aids for Exam Success

**For Types of Justice**: Think "DPI" like dots per inch on a screen—Distributive (outcomes), Procedural (process), Interactional (communication).

**For Commitment Types**: Remember "ACN" like a professional designation—Affective (want to stay), Continuance (need to stay), Normative (ought to stay).

**For GAS Stages**: Think "ARE"—Alarm, Resistance, Exhaustion. Each word describes the body's state: alarmed → resisting → exhausted.

**For Hardiness Components**: "Three C's"—Control, Commitment, Challenge. All positive concepts starting with C.

**For Burnout Characteristics**: "EDI"—Exhaustion, Depersonalization, Inefficacy. Imagine your sense of professional identity (ID) being eaten away.

## Key Takeaways

- **Job satisfaction shows stability across time and jobs**, influenced by self-esteem, affective disposition, and genetics (about 30% heritable)

- **Three types of organizational justice matter**: distributive (fairness of outcomes), procedural (fairness of processes), and interactional (fairness of communication)

- **Satisfaction correlates modestly with performance** (.30 correlation), and performance may cause satisfaction (through rewards) rather than vice versa

- **Affective commitment** (emotional attachment) shows the strongest relationship with positive job outcomes compared to continuance or normative commitment

- **General Adaptation Syndrome has three stages**: alarm reaction (fight-or-flight activation), resistance (sustained coping), and exhaustion (system breakdown)

- **Chronic stress causes elevated cortisol**, which suppresses immunity, increases cardiovascular risk, and damages hippocampal cells involved in memory

- **Major workplace stressors include**: lack of control (most reliable predictor), work-family conflict, and downsizing (affects both victims and survivors)

- **Job burnout has three core features**: exhaustion, depersonalization/cynicism, and sense of inefficacy

You've now got the framework for understanding how satisfaction, commitment, and stress operate in organizational settings. When you see these questions on the EPPP, you'll recognize not just the correct answer, but why it's correct—and that deeper understanding is what separates those who pass from those who excel.
