# Organizational Change and Development: A Practical Guide for EPPP Success

## Introduction: Why Change Is Hard (And How Organizations Deal With It)

You've probably heard someone say "we've always done it this way" at work, even when that way clearly isn't working anymore. Organizations, like people, resist change. They get comfortable with routines, even dysfunctional ones. But market shifts, new technology, and evolving employee needs mean companies must adapt or die.

Understanding organizational change isn't just about memorizing theories for the EPPP. It's about recognizing patterns you'll see throughout your psychology career—whether you're consulting with companies, working in a hospital system, or managing your own practice. When leadership announces a new electronic health records system, or your clinic reorganizes its team structure, you're witnessing organizational change in action. The theories you'll learn here explain why some changes stick and others fail spectacularly.

Think of organizational change like updating your smartphone's operating system. Everyone knows updates are necessary, but timing matters, preparation is crucial, and if you don't follow through properly, you end up with a glitchy phone that's worse than before. Organizations face the same challenge on a much larger scale.

## The Foundation: Lewin's Three-Step Model

Back in 1951, Kurt Lewin created a model that's still taught today because it captures something essential about how change works. His three-step model isn't fancy, but it's sticky—and you'll definitely see it on the EPPP.

### Unfreezing: Breaking the Ice

Imagine you're in a long-term relationship that's become comfortable but stagnant. Before you can improve things, you first need to acknowledge that change is necessary. You identify what's keeping you stuck (maybe you've fallen into boring routines) and what might motivate change (remembering why you got together in the first place, or recognizing you're both unhappy).

In organizations, unfreezing means identifying forces maintaining the status quo and forces pushing for change. Maybe employees are stuck in outdated procedures because "that's how we've always done it" (restraining force), but customer complaints are mounting (driving force). The goal is to reduce those restraining forces and amplify the driving forces until the organization becomes ready—or even eager—for change.

### Changing: Making the Move

This is the actual transition phase. You're implementing new procedures, training employees on new systems, or restructuring teams. Using our relationship metaphor, this is when you're actually trying new activities together, communicating differently, or addressing old patterns.

The key here is that you're moving from one state to another. It's messy, uncomfortable, and requires active management. People need support during this phase because change creates uncertainty.

### Refreezing: Locking It In

Here's where many change efforts fail. You can't just implement something new and walk away. Refreezing means integrating the change into the organization's culture so it becomes "the way we do things now" rather than "that new thing management is making us try."

Think about trying to establish a new habit. The first few weeks of going to the gym require willpower and reminders. But after several months, it becomes automatic—part of your identity. Organizations need that same solidification. This might involve updating official policies, linking the new behavior to rewards and recognition, and celebrating success stories that reinforce the change.

## The Modern Approach: Cummings and Worley's General Model

While Lewin's model remains foundational, Cummings and Worley expanded this framework into something more detailed and practical. Their model breaks change into four phases that reflect what actually happens in real-world organizational development projects.

| Phase | Key Focus | Primary Activities |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Entering and Contracting | Establishing the relationship | Identify problems, select consultant, set expectations, create agreement |
| Diagnosing | Understanding the issues | Collect data, analyze patterns, provide feedback to organization |
| Planning and Implementing | Making change happen | Create vision, design interventions, manage transition, sustain momentum |
| Evaluating and Institutionalizing | Making it stick | Measure results, adjust as needed, integrate into culture |

### Entering and Contracting: Setting the Stage

When you start dating someone, you don't immediately move in together. You first get to know each other, establish what you're both looking for, and figure out if you're compatible. Similarly, when an organization brings in an OD practitioner (a consultant who specializes in organizational development), there's a courtship period.

The organization identifies its pain points—maybe turnover is high, productivity is dropping, or departments aren't collaborating. They select someone to help (the OD practitioner) and establish a working relationship. The consultant gathers initial information and works with key stakeholders to create a contract specifying expectations, outcomes, and how they'll work together.

This phase matters because unclear expectations torpedo change efforts. If leadership thinks they're hiring someone to "fix" employees, but the consultant discovers the real problem is leadership's communication style, conflict is inevitable.

### Diagnosing: Getting to the Root Cause

Your car's check engine light comes on. You could guess what's wrong, but a mechanic runs diagnostics to identify the actual problem. Organizations need the same systematic approach.

The diagnosing phase involves collecting data at multiple levels—individual employees, work groups, and the overall organization. This might include surveys, interviews, observations, and reviewing performance metrics. The OD practitioner analyzes this information and provides feedback to the organization about what they discovered.

Good diagnosis reveals patterns people inside the organization might miss because they're too close to the situation. Maybe what looks like "lazy employees" is actually unclear role expectations creating paralysis.

### Planning and Implementing: The Hard Work Begins

This is where theory meets reality. The organization needs to design specific interventions (we'll discuss these shortly) and create an action plan. But first, they must assess readiness to change. Is leadership truly committed? Do employees have the skills they'll need? Are there sufficient resources?

Creating a compelling vision matters here. People tolerate discomfort when they understand where they're heading and why it's worth the struggle. Think about graduate school—you endured stress, long hours, and financial strain because you had a clear vision of becoming a psychologist.

Managing the transition means providing support, resources, and training. It also means sustaining momentum when enthusiasm wanes (which it always does). Quick wins help maintain energy, as do visible leadership commitment and addressing obstacles promptly.

### Evaluating and Institutionalizing: Closing the Loop

How do you know if the change worked? Organizations need clear metrics and regular evaluation. Did employee engagement improve? Did customer satisfaction increase? Are the new processes actually being used?

Based on evaluation data, leaders decide whether to continue, modify, or suspend changes. Institutionalization—making changes permanent—requires integrating them into formal systems like training programs, performance reviews, and reward structures. If you want people to keep using a new procedure, recognize and reward those who do it well.

## Methods of Organizational Development: The Toolbox

Remember the opening quote: organizational development is a "toolbox of various methods for affecting change." Here are the key tools you'll need to know for the EPPP.

### Survey Feedback: Listening at Scale

Survey feedback follows a simple three-step process: collect data, provide feedback, develop an action plan. The organization surveys employees about attitudes, opinions, and perceptions regarding work conditions, supervision, policies, and other important issues.

The results get summarized and shared back with employees. This transparency helps everyone understand the organization's current state—both strengths and weaknesses. Employees then recommend solutions, and management develops an action plan (usually with the consultant's help).

This method works because it gives employees a voice and grounds decisions in actual data rather than assumptions. It's like how couples therapy often starts with each person describing their experience before developing solutions together.

### Process Consultation: Teaching to Fish

You know the saying: give someone a fish, feed them for a day; teach them to fish, feed them for a lifetime. Process consultation embodies that philosophy.

The process consultant doesn't provide answers. Instead, they help the organization diagnose and solve its own problems by focusing on processes—how people communicate, make decisions, solve problems, and relate interpersonally. The consultant might observe meetings and point out patterns: "I noticed that when Sarah shares ideas, they're dismissed quickly, but when Mark says the same thing later, everyone agrees. What's happening there?"

The goal is organizational self-reliance. After working with a process consultant, the organization has built capabilities to identify and address future problems independently.

### Self-Managed Work Teams: Democracy at Work

Imagine a team with no boss. Self-managed work teams (SMWTs) have complete responsibility for their own work, including budgets, task assignments, methods, schedules, hiring, training, and performance appraisal. Leadership roles rotate based on who has relevant expertise for current challenges.

This sounds chaotic, but research shows SMWTs can increase employee satisfaction and productivity when implemented properly. They work best when team members have strong interpersonal skills, the organization provides adequate training, and the team has clear boundaries about what they control.

Think of it like a band where everyone contributes their expertise—sometimes the drummer leads on rhythm decisions, sometimes the guitarist leads on melody, but everyone shares responsibility for the final product.

### Technostructural Interventions: Redesigning Work Itself

These interventions change an organization's technology or structure to improve work methods, content, and relationships while reducing costs. Key approaches include:

**Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**: This involves radically redesigning core processes to increase efficiency. Rather than tweaking existing procedures, BPR questions everything and rebuilds from scratch. It's like renovating your entire apartment rather than just rearranging furniture.

**Job Enrichment**: Originally described by Herzberg, job enrichment designs jobs to provide responsibility, challenge, advancement opportunities, and other factors that increase satisfaction and motivation. Instead of making someone's job easier or more pleasant (job satisfaction factors like good pay), you make it more meaningful by increasing autonomy and impact.

**Alternative Work Schedules**: Two main types appear frequently on the EPPP:

| Schedule Type | Description | Key Research Findings |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Compressed Workweek | Fewer workdays with longer hours (e.g., four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days) | Strong positive effect on job satisfaction; weaker positive effect on productivity; unclear effects on absenteeism |
| Flextime | Required total hours and core time (e.g., must work 8 hours including 10am-2pm), but flexible start/end times | Strongest effect is reducing absenteeism; weakest effect is on self-rated performance |

These findings matter for the exam. Note that flextime most strongly affects absenteeism (people can schedule appointments without missing work), while compressed workweek most strongly affects satisfaction (people value three-day weekends).

### Total Quality Management: Continuous Improvement Culture

Total Quality Management (TQM) emphasizes continuous improvement through incremental changes to all processes. Rather than occasional big overhauls, TQM creates a culture where everyone constantly looks for small ways to improve quality.

Core characteristics include top management commitment, employee involvement, teamwork, customer focus, and data-driven decision-making. Three specific TQM techniques appear on the EPPP:

**Quality Circles**: Small groups of volunteer employees meet regularly to identify quality and productivity problems and recommend solutions to management. It's like a book club, but instead of discussing novels, you're discussing how to improve work processes.

**Benchmarking**: Continuously measuring your products, services, and practices against major competitors or industry leaders to identify improvement opportunities. Think of it like checking what features the newest smartphones have so you know what to include in your next model.

**Six Sigma**: A systematic approach that trains employees in statistical analysis, project management, and problem-solving to reduce product defects. The name comes from the statistical goal of achieving near-perfection (99.99966% defect-free).

### Appreciative Inquiry: Focus on Strengths

Most organizational change focuses on problems—what's wrong and how to fix it. Appreciative inquiry flips this by identifying what's working well and building on those strengths. Combining social constructionism and positive psychology, it asks: "What are we doing right, and how can we do more of it?"

The process follows the "4D cycle":

1. **Discovery** (appreciate "what is"): Identify the organization's unique strengths and best aspects
2. **Dream** (envision "what could be"): Generate inspiring possibilities based on those strengths
3. **Design** (determine "what should be"): Create concrete plans for achieving that vision
4. **Delivery/Destiny** (sustain "what will be"): Implement and sustain the changes

This approach works particularly well when organizations are demoralized or stuck in problem-focused thinking. It's similar to how solution-focused therapy helps clients by exploring exceptions—times when the problem isn't happening—rather than dwelling on pathology.

## Program Logic Models: Mapping the Journey

In recent years, program logic models have become essential tools for planning, implementing, and evaluating any type of program—from employee wellness initiatives to management training to community prevention programs.

Think of a program logic model as a roadmap showing how you'll get from "here's our problem" to "here's our desired outcome." It's typically a flowchart with arrows showing causal relationships between components.

### The Key Components

**Inputs** are the resources needed to support your program: people (managers, consultants), money (budget, funding sources), organizational assets (data, existing programs), and community resources. Without adequate inputs, your program can't function—like trying to cook a meal without ingredients or equipment.

**Activities** are the processes and actions that produce outputs: developing materials, conducting training sessions, collecting data, facilitating meetings. These are the actual work you'll do.

**Outputs** are the direct, tangible results of your activities: number of employees trained, training satisfaction ratings, materials produced, meetings held. Outputs answer "what did we do and how much?"

**Outcomes** are the changes or benefits expected from your activities and outputs. These typically include:
- Short-term outcomes: immediate changes (increased knowledge after training)
- Intermediate outcomes: changes that take more time (changed behaviors or practices)
- Long-term outcomes: ultimate goals (improved organizational performance, reduced employee turnover)

### Why Logic Models Matter

Creating a logic model during planning forces you to articulate your theory of change: if we provide these resources and do these activities, we expect these specific results because of these causal mechanisms. This prevents the common problem of implementing programs without clear reasoning about how they're supposed to work.

For example, if you're designing a stress management program for healthcare workers, your logic model might show:
- Inputs: budget, trainers, meeting rooms, assessment tools
- Activities: six weekly 90-minute training sessions on stress reduction techniques
- Outputs: 50 nurses complete training, 90% satisfaction rate
- Short-term outcome: increased knowledge of stress management strategies
- Intermediate outcome: regular practice of stress reduction techniques
- Long-term outcome: reduced burnout rates and turnover

The arrows between components force you to articulate why attending training leads to increased knowledge, how knowledge translates to behavior change, and how behavior change reduces burnout. If you can't draw convincing arrows, you might need to rethink your program design.

## Common Misconceptions Students Get Wrong

**Misconception 1**: "Organizational change is just about announcing new policies."
Reality: Change requires unfreezing existing patterns, actively managing the transition, and refreezing to make changes stick. Most change efforts fail during implementation or institutionalization, not because the idea was bad.

**Misconception 2**: "All OD interventions work the same way."
Reality: Different methods target different issues. Process consultation builds internal capability; survey feedback leverages employee voice; appreciative inquiry focuses on strengths. Match the tool to the problem.

**Misconception 3**: "Flextime and compressed workweeks have the same effects."
Reality: Research shows different outcomes. Flextime most strongly reduces absenteeism; compressed workweek most strongly increases satisfaction. Don't assume alternative schedules are interchangeable.

**Misconception 4**: "Lewin's model is outdated, so focus only on Cummings and Worley."
Reality: Lewin's model remains foundational. Cummings and Worley's model expands it but doesn't replace it. You need to know both for the EPPP.

**Misconception 5**: "Program logic models are just for evaluation."
Reality: Logic models are planning tools created before implementing programs. They help teams articulate their theory of change and identify potential problems before investing resources.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For Lewin's Three-Step Model**: Think ICE
- **I**dentify forces and reduce resistance (Unfreezing)
- **C**hange to new state (Changing)  
- **E**stablish and stabilize (Refreezing)

**For Cummings and Worley's Model**: Remember "Every Day People Eat" for the four phases
- **E**ntering and contracting
- **D**iagnosing
- **P**lanning and implementing
- **E**valuating and institutionalizing

**For Alternative Work Schedules**: Create a clear mental image
- **Flextime** = **Flexible** schedule = Reduces **A**bsenteeism (people can schedule appointments)
- **Compressed** = **C**rushes week together = Increases **S**atisfaction (love those 3-day weekends)

**For Appreciative Inquiry's 4Ds**: Think of a romantic relationship
- **D**iscover what you love about your partner (what's working)
- **D**ream about your future together (what's possible)
- **D**esign specific plans (how you'll get there)
- **D**eliver on those plans (make it happen and sustain it)

**For Program Logic Model Components**: Remember "I/O Psychology" uses Inputs/Outputs
- **I**nputs (resources) → **A**ctivities (actions) → **O**utputs (products) → **O**utcomes (results)

## Key Takeaways

- **Organizational change is a process that requires systematic management**, not just good ideas. Lewin's unfreezing-changing-refreezing model captures essential dynamics that still apply today.

- **Cummings and Worley's four-phase model** (entering/contracting, diagnosing, planning/implementing, evaluating/institutionalizing) provides a practical framework for managing real-world change projects.

- **Different OD interventions serve different purposes**: Survey feedback gathers employee input, process consultation builds internal capacity, SMWTs increase autonomy, TQM creates continuous improvement culture, and appreciative inquiry leverages strengths.

- **Technostructural interventions** change how work is done through BPR, job enrichment, or alternative schedules. Know the specific research findings for flextime (strongest effect: reduced absenteeism) versus compressed workweek (strongest effect: increased satisfaction).

- **Program logic models** map the causal chain from inputs through activities and outputs to short-, intermediate-, and long-term outcomes. They're created during planning to articulate program theory.

- **Successful change requires attention to all phases**: Many efforts fail not because of poor design but because of inadequate implementation or failure to institutionalize changes into organizational culture.

- **For the EPPP**, focus on being able to distinguish between different models and methods, match interventions to organizational problems, and recall specific research findings about intervention effectiveness.
