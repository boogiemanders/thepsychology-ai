## Why Organizational Change Matters for Your EPPP Prep

You know that feeling when you realize your usual approach to something just isn't working anymore? Maybe you've been studying the same way for years, but now you need to switch things up to pass the EPPP. Or perhaps you've seen a workplace struggle to adapt when leadership changes or new technology gets introduced. That resistance, that friction, that eventual shift—that's organizational change in action.

For the EPPP, understanding organizational change and development isn't just about memorizing models. It's about recognizing how organizations (from therapy clinics to hospitals to corporations) actually transform, why they resist, and what strategies genuinely work. You'll need to distinguish between different change models and know which intervention fits which situation.

Let's break this down in a way that sticks.

## The Foundation: What Are We Actually Talking About?

Here's the simple distinction: **Organizational change** is the transformation itself—the shift from how things are to how they could be. **Organizational development (OD)** is the toolkit you use to make that change happen. It's the difference between "we need to lose weight" and "here are the specific diet and exercise strategies we'll use."

Think of organizational change as both a journey and a destination. Sometimes you're focused on the process of getting there; other times you're fixated on the end goal. Most of the time, you need to pay attention to both.

## Lewin's Three-Step Model: The Classic Framework

Kurt Lewin created one of the earliest and most enduring models for understanding planned change back in 1951. {{M}}It's like changing your relationship status—there's a clear before, during, and after.{{/M}}

### Unfreezing

This is where you recognize that the current situation can't continue. You identify what's keeping things stuck in place and what forces could shake things up.

{{M}}Imagine you're in a job that's become comfortable but unfulfilling. Unfreezing means acknowledging that your fear of change and your steady paycheck are keeping you locked in place (forces maintaining the status quo), while your growing frustration and new career opportunities are pushing you toward change (forces disrupting the status quo).{{/M}}

### Changing

This is the actual transition period—implementing the new way of doing things. The organization moves from its old equilibrium to a new one. This is typically the messiest phase because everything's in flux.

### Refreezing

Once the change is implemented, you need to lock it in place. This means integrating the new approach into the culture, values, and standard operating procedures. Without refreezing, organizations tend to drift back to their old ways.

{{M}}If you finally commit to a morning exercise routine, refreezing means building it so deeply into your daily schedule that skipping feels weird, not doing it.{{/M}} You've created a new normal.

## The More Detailed Roadmap: Cummings and Worley's General Model

While Lewin gave us three broad stages, Cummings and Worley (2015) expanded this into a four-phase model that incorporates more nuance. Think of this as the GPS navigation version—more detailed waypoints along the journey.

### Phase 1: Entering and Contracting

This is the setup phase. The organization figures out what's wrong, identifies who needs to be involved, and brings in an OD practitioner (a change consultant). Key activities include:

- Identifying primary problems
- Establishing collaborative relationships
- Gathering initial information
- Setting clear expectations about outcomes
- Creating a formal agreement about how everyone will work together

{{M}}This is like when you first meet with a personal trainer. You discuss your fitness goals, your current habits, what's realistic, and you agree on how often you'll meet and what you're both responsible for.{{/M}}

### Phase 2: Diagnosing

Here's where you dive deep into understanding the problems. This involves collecting and analyzing information at three levels: organization-wide, within teams or groups, and at the individual level. Then you provide feedback to the organization about what you've discovered.

The diagnostic phase is crucial because you can't fix what you don't understand. Many change efforts fail because organizations skip thorough diagnosis and jump straight to solutions.

### Phase 3: Planning and Implementing

This is where the rubber meets the road. Key components include:

- **Assessing readiness**: Is the organization actually prepared to change, or are people going to resist?
- **Creating vision**: Where exactly are we headed?
- **Designing interventions**: What specific methods will we use?
- **Managing the transition**: How do we guide people through the messy middle?
- **Sustaining momentum**: How do we keep energy high and provide necessary support?

This phase requires continuous attention to employee competencies—do people have the skills they need for the new way of working?

### Phase 4: Evaluating and Institutionalizing

Change isn't complete just because you implemented something new. This phase involves:

- Evaluating whether the interventions worked
- Deciding if changes should continue, need modification, or should be suspended
- Institutionalizing successful changes through feedback, rewards, and ongoing training

This is the phase that determines whether your change becomes permanent or just another failed initiative that people reference cynically in the break room.

## The OD Toolkit: Specific Methods for Creating Change

Now let's look at the actual techniques organizations use to create change. For the EPPP, you'll want to recognize these methods and understand when each is most appropriate.

### Survey Feedback

This three-step approach is straightforward:

1. **Collect data**: Employees at all levels complete surveys about their attitudes, perceptions, and opinions regarding work conditions, supervision, policies, and other important issues
2. **Provide feedback**: Results are summarized and shared with employees to reveal organizational strengths and weaknesses
3. **Develop action plan**: Employees make recommendations, and management creates an action plan (often with consultant help)

The key insight here is that employees are engaged throughout the process. They're not just passive subjects—they help identify problems and solutions.

### Process Consultation

Unlike some consulting approaches where an expert comes in and tells you what to do, process consultation focuses on helping organizations become self-reliant. The consultant examines organizational processes—communication patterns, decision-making, problem-solving, interpersonal relationships—and helps the organization learn to diagnose and resolve its own problems.

{{M}}It's like therapy versus advice-giving. A good therapist doesn't just tell you what to do; they help you develop the insight and skills to solve your own problems.{{/M}}

The process consultant is more guide than guru.

### Self-Managed Work Teams (SMWTs)

These are groups of employees who have complete responsibility and control over their work, including:

- Budgeting
- Task assignments
- Work methods
- Schedules
- Hiring and training
- Performance appraisal

There's no traditional supervisor. Leadership roles shift depending on who has the relevant expertise for the current situation.

{{M}}Think of a successful band on tour—different members take the lead depending on the context. One person might handle logistics, another manages finances, someone else leads creative decisions, all without a traditional "boss."{{/M}}

### Technostructural Interventions

These interventions focus on changing the organization's technology or structure. They include several specific approaches:

**Business Process Reengineering (BPR)**: This involves radically redesigning core organizational processes (financial systems, communication networks, etc.) to dramatically increase efficiency. It's not about tweaking—it's about fundamental redesign.

**Job Enrichment**: Based on Herzberg's work, this involves designing jobs to provide more responsibility, challenge, advancement opportunities, and other factors that increase satisfaction and motivation. The focus is on job content factors (motivators) rather than just job context factors (like pay and working conditions).

**Alternative Work Schedules**: Two main types appear frequently on the EPPP:

| Schedule Type | Description | Effects |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Compressed Workweek** | Fewer workdays with longer hours each day (e.g., four 10-hour days) | Strong positive effect on job satisfaction; moderate positive effect on productivity; unclear effects on absenteeism |
| **Flextime** | Required total hours and core time, but flexible start/end times | Strongest effect on reducing absenteeism; weakest effect on self-rated performance; beneficial overall |

Notice the research findings here—different schedules have different outcomes. For the EPPP, remember that flextime's biggest win is reducing absenteeism, not boosting performance.

### Total Quality Management (TQM)

TQM emphasizes continuous improvement through small, incremental changes to all processes. Key characteristics include:

- Top management commitment to quality
- Employee involvement throughout
- Team-based approach
- Focus on customer satisfaction
- Data-driven decision-making

Three specific TQM techniques you should know:

**Quality Circles (QCs)**: Small groups of employees who volunteer to meet regularly, identify problems related to quality and productivity, discuss solutions, and provide recommendations to management. The emphasis is on voluntary participation and employee expertise.

**Benchmarking**: A continuous process of comparing your organization's products, services, and practices against leading competitors or industry leaders. The goal is identifying best practices to improve your own processes and quality.

{{M}}It's like checking how other students prepared for the EPPP—what study materials did they use? How many hours did they study? What strategies worked? You're not copying; you're learning from proven approaches.{{/M}}

**Six Sigma**: A statistical approach that provides training in data analysis, project management, and problem-solving to reduce product defects. The name comes from the statistical concept of six standard deviations from the mean—essentially aiming for near-perfect quality.

### Appreciative Inquiry

This approach combines social constructionism (the idea that people create shared understanding through interaction) with positive psychology (focusing on strengths rather than deficits). Instead of asking "What's broken and how do we fix it?" appreciative inquiry asks "What's working and how do we build on it?"

The process follows a **4D cycle**:

| Phase | Focus | Key Question |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Discovery** | Appreciate "what is" | What are our greatest strengths and successes? |
| **Dream** | Envision "what could be" | What would our ideal future look like? |
| **Design** | Determine "what should be" | What systems and structures would create that future? |
| **Delivery/Destiny** | Sustain "what will be" | How do we maintain momentum and continuous improvement? |

This approach is notably different from traditional problem-focused change methods. It's strength-based rather than deficit-based.

## The Program Logic Model: Planning for Success

Here's a concept that's gained significant attention in recent years: the program logic model. While it can apply to any organizational program, understanding its components helps you grasp how organizations plan, implement, and evaluate changes systematically.

A **program theory** (or theory of change) represents the assumptions about what resources and activities lead to intended outcomes. A **program logic model** is the visual tool—usually a flowchart—that maps out this theory.

{{M}}Think of it like planning a cross-country road trip. The program logic model is your detailed map showing the route, necessary stops for gas and food, expected arrival times, and your final destination. It helps everyone involved understand the journey from start to finish.{{/M}}

### Core Components of a Logic Model

These components are typically connected by arrows showing causal relationships:

**Inputs**: The resources needed to support the program—people (managers, consultants), money (funding sources), data sources, organizational capacity. These are your raw materials.

**Activities**: The actual processes and actions needed to produce results—developing training materials, conducting workshops, collecting data, coordinating meetings.

**Outputs**: The direct, tangible products of your activities—number of employees trained, number of training sessions completed, satisfaction ratings from participants.

**Outcomes**: The short-term, intermediate, and long-term changes or benefits expected from the program—changes in employee knowledge and skills (short-term), changes in behavior and practices (intermediate), improved organizational performance or reduced turnover (long-term).

Here's a simple example:

```
INPUTS → ACTIVITIES → OUTPUTS → OUTCOMES
(Trainers, funding, materials) → (Conduct leadership workshops) → (50 managers trained) → (Improved management skills → Better team performance → Reduced turnover)
```

More complex logic models might also include the problem being addressed at the beginning and the expected long-term community or organizational impact at the end.

The value of creating a logic model during the planning stage is that it forces stakeholders to clarify their assumptions about how change will occur. It's a road map that keeps everyone aligned about where you're going and how you'll get there.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception #1: "All change follows the same process"**

Reality: Different situations require different approaches. A small team communication problem needs different intervention than a complete organizational restructuring. Process consultation makes sense for the former; business process reengineering might be necessary for the latter.

**Misconception #2: "Change models are rigid, sequential steps"**

Reality: While models present phases in order, real organizational change is messier. You might be implementing changes while still diagnosing new problems, or you might need to return to earlier phases. The models are frameworks, not recipes.

**Misconception #3: "Refreezing means making things permanent and unchangeable"**

Reality: Refreezing means stabilizing the new state so it becomes the new normal, but this doesn't mean the organization becomes rigid. Organizations must continuously adapt; refreezing just prevents backsliding to old patterns before new ones are established.

**Misconception #4: "OD interventions work universally"**

Reality: Context matters enormously. Self-managed work teams work well in some cultures and industries but fail in others. Survey feedback is effective when organizations are genuinely open to employee input but can backfire when management ignores results.

**Misconception #5: "The consultant/OD practitioner should provide all the answers"**

Reality: Effective OD, especially process consultation, focuses on building the organization's capacity to solve its own problems. The consultant is more facilitator than expert problem-solver.

## Practice Tips for Remembering This Material

**Use the acronym "UCRE-DPI"** for the phases of change in Cummings and Worley's model:
- **U**nderstand (Entering and Contracting)
- **C**hecklist (Diagnosing)
- **R**oll out (Planning and Implementing)
- **E**valuate (Evaluating and Institutionalizing)

**Create a methods matching game**: Make flashcards with organizational scenarios on one side and the most appropriate OD method on the other. Practice matching them until it becomes automatic.

**Remember flextime's superpower**: "**Flex**ible schedules **flex** against **absences**"—its strongest effect is reducing absenteeism, not improving performance.

**Link TQM techniques to their essence**:
- Quality Circles = employee circles of expertise
- Benchmarking = comparing to the best
- Six Sigma = statistical precision

**For Lewin's model**, remember "**UFR**" (Unfreeze, Change, Refreeze) and think about the physical metaphor: ice must melt (unfreeze), change shape when liquid (changing), then solidify into a new form (refreeze).

**Distinguish logic model components** by their nature:
- Inputs = What you **have**
- Activities = What you **do**
- Outputs = What you **produce**
- Outcomes = What **changes**

## Key Takeaways

- **Organizational change** is the transformation itself; **organizational development** is the toolkit of methods to create that change

- **Lewin's three-step model** (Unfreeze, Change, Refreeze) remains influential and emphasizes that change requires disrupting the current state, implementing new approaches, and stabilizing the new state

- **Cummings and Worley's model** expands on Lewin with four detailed phases: Entering and Contracting, Diagnosing, Planning and Implementing, and Evaluating and Institutionalizing

- **Survey feedback** engages employees in identifying problems and solutions through data collection, feedback, and action planning

- **Process consultation** helps organizations become self-reliant by focusing on organizational processes rather than providing direct solutions

- **Self-managed work teams** give employees complete control over their work without traditional supervisors

- **Technostructural interventions** include business process reengineering, job enrichment, and alternative work schedules (compressed workweek and flextime)

- **Flextime's strongest effect** is reducing absenteeism; compressed workweeks most strongly affect job satisfaction

- **Total Quality Management** emphasizes continuous, incremental improvement with specific techniques including quality circles, benchmarking, and six sigma

- **Appreciative inquiry** takes a strength-based approach through the 4D cycle: Discovery, Dream, Design, and Delivery/Destiny

- **Program logic models** provide a visual roadmap connecting inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes to help stakeholders understand how programs create change

- **Effective change** requires attention to diagnosis, implementation, and institutionalization—not just launching new initiatives

For the EPPP, focus on distinguishing between different change models and matching specific OD interventions to appropriate organizational situations. Understanding the research findings on alternative work schedules and the unique characteristics of each approach will help you select correct answers confidently.
