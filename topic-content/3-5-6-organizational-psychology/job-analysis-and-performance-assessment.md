## Why Understanding Job Analysis and Performance Assessment Matters

You're sitting at your desk when your supervisor emails asking you to rate your colleague's performance. Or maybe you're applying for a new position and wondering what the hiring team is really looking for. Perhaps you're the one designing a training program and need to figure out what skills people actually need. These scenarios all hinge on the same organizational psychology concepts: how do we figure out what a job requires, and how do we measure whether someone's doing it well?

These aren't just abstract HR concepts—they're the machinery running beneath every workplace interaction. For the EPPP, you'll need to understand not just what these processes are, but why they exist and when they go wrong. More importantly, as psychologists, you might consult with organizations struggling with these exact issues, or work within systems where you're being evaluated using these methods.

Let's break down how organizations figure out what work needs doing and whether it's getting done right.

## The Three Ways Organizations Define Work

Before anyone can be hired, trained, or evaluated, someone needs to answer a fundamental question: what does this job actually involve? Three related but distinct processes tackle this question from different angles.

### Job Analysis: The Detailed Blueprint

**Job analysis** is like creating a recipe and a shopping list at the same time. It systematically identifies how work gets done, what conditions surround the work, and what personal qualities someone needs to do it well. 

When a hospital wants to hire a new clinical psychologist, they can't just wing it. They need to know: What does this person do all day? Do they conduct therapy? Supervise students? Attend team meetings? Write reports? And what skills make someone good at this particular job?

Job analysis serves multiple purposes:
- Writing accurate job descriptions
- Creating fair selection tests
- Identifying what training people need
- Redesigning jobs that aren't working

Getting this information requires detective work. Organizations might watch employees work, interview people doing the job, send out surveys, or even use electronic monitoring to track what actually happens versus what people assume happens.

**Two Approaches to Understanding Jobs**

Think of these as two different camera lenses for looking at the same thing:

| Approach | Focus | Example Question |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **Work-Oriented** | What tasks get completed? | "What specific activities does this therapist perform each day?" |
| **Worker-Oriented** | What qualities does the person need? | "What knowledge, skills, and abilities make someone successful at therapy?" |

A **work-oriented job analysis** zooms in on tasks. For example, "conducts intake assessments," "writes treatment plans," "documents sessions within 24 hours." This approach, called task analysis, typically involves having employees and supervisors list everything the job entails, then rating each task by how often it happens and how important it is. High-frequency, high-importance tasks make it into the official job description.

A **worker-oriented job analysis** steps back to examine the person rather than the tasks. It identifies the KSAOs—knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics—needed to do the work. The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) is a standardized worker-oriented tool covering six areas: how information enters the job, what mental work is required, what the person produces, how they interact with others, the working environment, and other job characteristics.

### Competency Modeling: The Organizational DNA

If job analysis is a detailed recipe for one dish, **competency modeling** identifies the cooking philosophy that applies across your entire restaurant.

Competency modeling always focuses on the person (it's always worker-oriented), but instead of asking what one specific job needs, it identifies core attributes required across multiple jobs or the entire organization. These competencies connect directly to the organization's values and strategic goals.

Here's the distinction: Job analysis might reveal that a therapist needs to "assess client symptoms" and "maintain confidentiality." Competency modeling might identify organization-wide competencies like "demonstrates cultural humility in all client interactions" or "adapts to changing healthcare regulations." 

These competencies aren't just nice-to-haves—they're the connective tissue linking individual jobs to organizational success. A hospital system committed to community health might identify "engages with underserved populations" as a core competency for everyone from psychologists to administrators.

### Job Evaluation: Determining What Work is Worth

**Job evaluation** takes the information from job analysis and adds one more question: what should we pay for this work?

This becomes especially important when addressing pay equity. The principle of **comparable worth** states that jobs requiring similar skills and responsibilities should receive similar compensation, even if the jobs themselves look different. This concept has been particularly relevant in addressing gender-based wage gaps—for instance, recognizing that nursing (historically female-dominated) might require comparable skills and responsibility to technical jobs (historically male-dominated) that pay more.

The **point system** is like a standardized scoring rubric for jobs. Organizations assign points to "compensable factors"—things like required skill level, physical effort, mental effort, responsibility, and working conditions. Add up the points, and you get a score that translates to a salary range. A clinical supervisor role might score high on mental effort and responsibility but low on physical effort and adverse working conditions, yielding a total that determines appropriate compensation.

## Measuring Performance: The Challenge of Knowing If Someone's Doing Well

Once someone is hired, the next challenge emerges: how do we know if they're succeeding? Performance measures—also called **criterion measures**—serve critical functions like providing feedback, making promotion decisions, and identifying training needs.

### Objective versus Subjective Measures

**Objective measures** are the numbers that seem straightforward: units produced, sales closed, errors made, days absent, accidents recorded. In some roles, these metrics capture performance beautifully. A data entry clerk's accuracy rate tells you something concrete.

But objective measures have limitations. Many jobs—like being a therapist—don't produce easily countable units. How do you quantify empathy or clinical judgment? Additionally, objective measures might not tell the whole story. A salesperson with lower numbers might be assigned a challenging territory. A psychologist with fewer completed assessments might be spending extra time with complex cases.

**Subjective measures** are performance ratings—someone's judgment about how well the work is being done. These are the most common approach in organizations because they're flexible, they can capture nuanced aspects of performance like "clinical judgment" or "collaboration," and they allow raters to consider context. The downside? Human judgment brings human bias.

### Relative versus Absolute Rating Methods

When creating subjective rating systems, organizations choose between comparing people to each other or evaluating each person independently.

**Relative Rating Scales: The Comparison Approach**

These methods force raters to rank employees against each other, like sorting people into tiers.

The **paired comparison technique** is exhaustive: you compare every employee to every other employee on each performance dimension. If you're rating five employees on "clinical skills," you'd compare Person A to Person B, Person A to Person C, Person A to Person D, Person A to Person E, then Person B to Person C, and so on. Whoever wins more comparisons ranks higher. This eliminates the temptation to rate everyone as "above average" (more on that bias later), but becomes ridiculously time-consuming with large groups. Rating 20 employees requires 190 paired comparisons per performance dimension.

The **forced distribution method** is like grading on a curve. It requires assigning specific percentages of employees to predetermined categories—maybe 10% to "poor," 20% to "below average," 40% to "average," 20% to "above average," and 10% to "excellent." 

This prevents rating inflation, but creates problems when the predetermined distribution doesn't match reality. What if you genuinely have a team where everyone performs well? Someone still has to get labeled "poor" to fill that bottom 10%. Companies like Microsoft famously abandoned forced distribution after it damaged morale and teamwork—people focused on outperforming colleagues rather than collaborating.

**Absolute Rating Scales: The Individual Approach**

These methods evaluate each person independently, without reference to others' performance.

The **critical incident technique** (CIT) starts by collecting specific examples of particularly good and particularly bad job behaviors. Observers watch employees work or interview people familiar with the job, noting concrete incidents: "Stayed two hours past shift end to support a client in crisis" or "Failed to document client sessions for three consecutive weeks." These incidents become a checklist for evaluation.

CIT provides wonderfully specific feedback—telling someone they "maintained professional boundaries" is clearer than saying they're "good at ethics." However, it's time-intensive to develop, focuses on extremes rather than everyday performance, and requires creating new incidents for each different job.

**Graphic rating scales** are the familiar Likert-style ratings you've probably encountered: rate this employee from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) on dimensions like "work quality," "punctuality," and "teamwork." These scales are incredibly easy to create, which explains their popularity. Unfortunately, their simplicity makes them vulnerable to all sorts of rater biases (coming up next).

**Behaviorally anchored rating scales** (BARS) improve on simple graphic scales by describing specific behaviors at each rating point. Instead of just "1 = poor, 5 = excellent," a BARS for "documentation quality" might describe:
- 5 = "Completes all session notes within 24 hours with comprehensive detail meeting all regulatory requirements"
- 3 = "Usually completes session notes within required timeframe with adequate detail"
- 1 = "Frequently submits late or incomplete session notes requiring supervisor follow-up"

BARS are developed by having job experts identify key performance dimensions and specific behaviors representing different performance levels. The behavioral descriptions reduce ambiguity and provide clearer feedback. The downside? They're time-consuming to create and job-specific, so you can't reuse them across different positions.

### The Gap Between Perfect and Practical Measurement

Organizational psychologists distinguish between the **ultimate criterion**—a perfect measure capturing everything that matters about job performance—and the **actual criterion**—what we actually measure.

This gap exists for two main reasons:

**Criterion deficiency** means we're missing important stuff. A job knowledge test for clinical psychologists covering only diagnosis and treatment but ignoring ethics, consultation skills, and cultural competence is deficient—it leaves out crucial aspects of actual performance.

**Criterion contamination** means we're measuring things we shouldn't. This happens when ratings get polluted by irrelevant factors. If your supervisor's ratings are influenced by knowing you were hired through a prestigious fellowship program, or by your gender or ethnicity, or simply by whether they like you personally, that's contamination. The ratings now reflect more than just your job performance.

## When Ratings Go Wrong: Understanding Rater Biases

Even with well-designed rating systems, human judgment introduces predictable errors. Recognizing these patterns helps both in designing better systems and in being a more accurate rater yourself.

### Distribution Errors: Using the Scale Wrong

**Central tendency bias** is when raters play it safe, giving everyone average ratings regardless of actual performance variation. It's like a professor who gives everyone a B. This might stem from discomfort with conflict, uncertainty about performance standards, or wanting to avoid difficult conversations about poor performance.

**Leniency bias** is grade inflation—everyone gets high ratings. A supervisor affected by leniency bias rates most employees as "excellent" or "above average," regardless of genuine performance differences. This might come from wanting to be liked, avoiding negative confrontations, or believing high ratings motivate people.

**Strictness bias** is the opposite: a harsh rater who scores everyone low. This supervisor seems impossible to please, rating most employees as mediocre or poor even when performance is solid.

All three distribution errors make ratings useless for making distinctions between employees, which defeats the purpose of evaluation.

### Halo Error: When One Thing Colors Everything

The **halo effect** happens when your rating on one dimension bleeds into ratings on unrelated dimensions. Your colleague is exceptionally organized—their treatment plans are models of clarity. Because you're impressed by this, you unconsciously rate them as excellent on everything else too: clinical skills, ethics, teamwork, even areas where they're actually just average.

This can run in reverse as a negative halo. A colleague who's chronically late gets lower ratings on unrelated dimensions like clinical judgment or report writing quality, even though their tardiness has nothing to do with those skills.

The halo error reflects a human tendency toward cognitive simplicity—forming an overall impression of someone ("they're great" or "they're problematic") and letting that impression override dimension-specific observations.

### Contrast Error: The Problem of Comparison

**Contrast error** occurs when your rating of one person is affected by whoever you rated immediately before. You evaluate an average performer right after evaluating an exceptional one, and the average performer looks worse by comparison—so you rate them lower than you would have otherwise.

It's like judging a decent meal right after eating at a Michelin-starred restaurant—the decent meal suffers unfairly. The reverse happens too: an average performer looks great compared to someone struggling, so they receive inflated ratings.

### Similarity Bias: We Like People Like Us

**Similarity bias** means giving higher ratings to people who remind us of ourselves. They share your background, your communication style, your approach to problems—and you unconsciously rate them more favorably. This bias contributes to problematic patterns where people from non-dominant groups receive lower ratings despite equivalent performance.

## Fixing Rating Problems: Strategies That Actually Work

Organizations have several tools for reducing bias and improving rating accuracy.

**Using relative rating scales** effectively eliminates distribution errors (central tendency, leniency, and strictness) because these scales force differentiation. You can't rate everyone as average or above average when the system requires you to rank people or assign them to a distribution.

**Anchoring scales with behavioral descriptions** (like BARS does) clarifies what each rating point means, reducing ambiguity that allows biases to creep in. Instead of wondering "what does 'good' mean?", raters have concrete behavioral examples.

**Rater training** is the most effective intervention—but only if done right. Older approaches focused just on teaching people about biases ("watch out for the halo effect!"). Research found this actually decreased overall accuracy because raters became so preoccupied with avoiding specific biases that they stopped making meaningful distinctions.

The better approach is **frame-of-reference (FOR) training**. This comprehensive training helps raters understand:
- Job performance is multidimensional (someone can be strong in some areas and weak in others)
- What the organization defines as effective versus ineffective performance
- How to observe and categorize performance accurately
- How to apply rating scales consistently

FOR training includes practice opportunities: raters watch performance examples, assign ratings, and receive feedback on their accuracy. This builds shared understanding of performance standards and consistent application across raters.

## Common Misconceptions About Job Analysis and Performance Assessment

**"Job analysis is just making a list of what someone does all day"** - Actually, job analysis goes deeper than task listing. Worker-oriented analysis identifies underlying attributes, work-oriented analysis prioritizes tasks by importance and frequency, and both connect to larger organizational functions like selection and training.

**"Objective measures are always better than subjective ones"** - Objective measures seem appealingly unbiased, but they're only useful when they actually capture important aspects of performance. For complex professional roles, subjective ratings that incorporate human judgment about quality, context, and nuance often provide more complete and fair assessment.

**"Forced distribution systems are fair because they prevent rating inflation"** - While forced distribution eliminates leniency bias, it creates unfairness when the predetermined distribution doesn't match actual performance variation. It can also damage collaboration by pitting employees against each other.

**"The halo effect means you think highly of someone overall"** - The halo effect specifically refers to allowing your rating on one dimension to influence ratings on unrelated dimensions. It's about contamination across dimensions, not general positive impression.

**"If we just educate raters about biases, ratings will become accurate"** - Simply warning about biases can actually decrease accuracy. Comprehensive FOR training that builds shared performance standards and includes feedback is more effective than just listing cognitive errors to avoid.

## Practice Tips for Remembering This Material

**Create a mental hierarchy:** Job analysis (understanding the job) comes first, then performance assessment (evaluating how well someone does it). Job evaluation is a specialized use of job analysis focused specifically on compensation.

**Use comparison tables:** Create a simple table comparing work-oriented versus worker-oriented analysis, or objective versus subjective measures. The EPPP loves questions that require distinguishing between similar concepts.

**Connect biases to personal experience:** You've probably encountered these rating errors in your own evaluations or when assessing others. The leniency bias professor, the supervisor who played favorites (similarity bias), the colleague who couldn't see past one negative trait (halo effect). Real examples make abstract concepts stick.

**Remember acronyms:** BARS = Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (the behavioral descriptions anchor each point). KSAOs = Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, Other characteristics (what worker-oriented analysis focuses on). FOR = Frame-Of-Reference training (the effective training approach).

**Think about criterion problems in research:** The ultimate versus actual criterion distinction applies beyond performance assessment. Any time psychologists measure constructs (intelligence, depression, personality), we face the same challenges of deficiency and contamination. This conceptual connection helps the information stick.

**Focus on the "why" for each method:** The EPPP doesn't just ask "what is paired comparison?" but "when would you use it?" Relative scales when you need to control distribution errors but have time. BARS when you want behavioral specificity but can invest development time. This functional understanding guides exam answers.

## Key Takeaways

- **Job analysis** systematically identifies how work is performed, job conditions, and personal requirements needed. It's foundational for job descriptions, selection, training, and job design.

- **Work-oriented analysis** focuses on tasks and outcomes; **worker-oriented analysis** focuses on KSAOs (knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics) needed.

- **Competency modeling** identifies core attributes required across multiple jobs in an organization, linked to organizational values and strategies.

- **Job evaluation** uses job analysis information specifically to determine appropriate compensation, often using a point system to score compensable factors.

- **Criterion measures** assess job performance. **Objective measures** (productivity, errors, absences) are quantitative but limited in scope. **Subjective measures** (ratings) are flexible but vulnerable to bias.

- **Relative rating scales** (paired comparison, forced distribution) compare employees to each other and eliminate distribution errors but can be time-consuming or create problems when actual performance doesn't match predetermined distributions.

- **Absolute rating scales** (critical incident technique, graphic scales, BARS) evaluate each person independently. BARS reduces bias by anchoring scale points with behavioral descriptions.

- **Ultimate criterion** is the ideal measure of all important performance aspects; **actual criterion** is what we really measure. The gap involves **criterion deficiency** (missing important elements) and **criterion contamination** (including irrelevant factors).

- **Rater biases** include distribution errors (central tendency, leniency, strictness), halo error (one dimension affecting ratings on unrelated dimensions), contrast error (previous ratee affecting current ratings), and similarity bias (favoring similar others).

- **Frame-of-reference (FOR) training** is most effective for improving rating accuracy. It builds shared understanding of multidimensional performance, organizational standards, and consistent scale application through practice and feedback.

Understanding these concepts prepares you not just for EPPP questions but for real organizational consulting work. Whether you're helping design selection systems, conducting workplace assessments, or simply navigating your own performance reviews, this knowledge provides the framework for fair, accurate, and useful workplace evaluation.
