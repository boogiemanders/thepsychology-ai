# Anxiety Disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Your Complete EPPP Guide

## Introduction & Core Concept

Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health issues worldwide. Think about that for a moment—not depression, not substance use disorders, but anxiety. This means you'll encounter these conditions constantly in clinical practice, regardless of your specialty. Understanding how to differentiate between specific anxiety disorders and recognize OCD patterns isn't just exam trivia; it's foundational knowledge you'll use daily.

Here's what makes anxiety disorders tricky: Everyone experiences anxiety. Your client who feels nervous before a job presentation isn't automatically diagnosing themselves correctly when they say "I have social anxiety." Your job is knowing where normal stress ends and a disorder begins. The DSM-5-TR draws this line by looking at three factors: intensity (is the fear way out of proportion?), duration (has it stuck around long enough?), and impact (is it messing up the person's life?). Keep these three questions in your mental toolkit.

## Understanding the Anxiety Disorder Landscape

Imagine anxiety disorders as a family of conditions that all share a common DNA—excessive fear and behavioral avoidance—but each member has its own personality. Let's meet the family.

### What Makes Someone Vulnerable?

Before diving into specific disorders, let's talk risk factors. Three big ones predict anxiety disorders:

1. **Stressful life events** - Major disruptions like divorce, job loss, or trauma
2. **Behavioral inhibition** - That temperament where a kid (or adult) consistently holds back in new situations
3. **Family history** - Having an anxious parent nearly doubles a child's risk

The genetics here matter for the exam. Studies show heritability between 30-50%, and concordance rates run about 12-26% for identical twins versus 4-15% for fraternal twins. These numbers tell you that genes load the gun, but environment pulls the trigger.

### Separation Anxiety Disorder: When Attachment Goes Overboard

Most people think of separation anxiety as a childhood thing, but adults get this diagnosis too. The core fear is being away from attachment figures—parents for kids, partners or family members for adults.

**The diagnostic picture includes at least three of eight symptoms, such as:**
- Excessive distress when separation is happening or about to happen
- Refusing to go to school or work because you fear being separated
- Physical complaints (headaches, stomachaches) when separation looms
- Nightmares about separation

Here's the timing rule: symptoms must last four weeks minimum in kids and adolescents, but six months in adults. Why the difference? Adults have more control over their environment, so symptoms need to be more persistent to count as pathological.

**School refusal deserves special attention.** When a child refuses school, you're playing detective. Is it separation anxiety (they want to stay with mom)? Social anxiety (they fear judgment from peers)? Or something else entirely? The child might say their stomach hurts, and they're not necessarily lying—anxiety creates real physical symptoms. It's their brain's alarm system flooding their body with stress hormones.

**Treatment approach:** CBT is your first-line intervention, combining psychoeducation, exposure, relaxation, and cognitive restructuring. Here's the key detail for the exam: adding parent training makes CBT more effective for children. And if school refusal is involved, getting the kid back to school immediately becomes priority one—not in a punitive way, but to prevent a cascade of problems like social isolation and academic failure.

### Specific Phobia: Fear With a Target

Specific phobia is straightforward: intense, persistent fear of a particular object or situation that gets avoided or endured with extreme distress. The fear must be out of proportion to actual danger, last at least six months, and significantly disrupt life.

**The DSM-5-TR uses five specifiers:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Animal | Snakes, spiders, dogs |
| Natural Environment | Heights, storms, water |
| Blood-Injection-Injury | Seeing blood, needles, medical procedures |
| Situational | Elevators, flying, bridges |
| Other | Choking, vomiting, loud sounds |

Average age of onset is around 10 years old, and it's about twice as common in girls as boys (though rates vary by phobia type).

**Mowrer's Two-Factor Theory** explains how phobias develop and persist. Picture this: Someone gets stuck in an elevator (unconditioned stimulus) and experiences panic (unconditioned response). Now elevators themselves (conditioned stimulus) trigger anxiety (conditioned response). That's classical conditioning. Then comes operant conditioning—they avoid elevators, which provides immediate relief (negative reinforcement). The avoidance feels good in the moment, but it prevents them from learning that elevators are actually safe. The fear never gets a chance to extinguish.

**Brain activity in phobias shows a pattern:** increased activity in emotion-generating areas (amygdala, insula, thalamus) and decreased activity in emotion-regulating areas (ventromedial prefrontal cortex). It's like having a sensitive car alarm with a broken off-switch.

**Treatment: Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)** is your gold standard, either alone or within CBT. Two delivery methods exist:

- **Flooding:** Immediate exposure to the most feared stimulus until anxiety subsides. Like jumping into the deep end.
- **Graded exposure:** Starting with less-feared situations and gradually working up. Like wading in from the shallow end.

Research findings you need to know:
- In vivo (real-life) beats imaginal exposure
- Therapist-led beats self-directed
- Virtual reality can equal in vivo for heights, flying, and small animals

**Special case:** Blood-injection-injury phobia has a unique response—initial heart rate spike followed by a drop that causes fainting. Treatment combines exposure with applied tension (tensing large muscle groups to maintain blood pressure and prevent fainting).

### Social Anxiety Disorder: Fear of the Spotlight

Social anxiety disorder involves fear or anxiety in social situations where scrutiny might occur. The person fears showing anxiety symptoms that others will negatively evaluate. Duration requirement: six months minimum.

Think of your client who calls in sick rather than give a presentation, not because they're unprepared, but because they're convinced everyone will notice their shaking hands and judge them as incompetent. That's the cognitive distortion at work—catastrophizing social evaluation.

**Treatment has two strong first-line options:**
1. Cognitive behavior therapy (exposure plus cognitive restructuring)
2. SSRIs and SNRIs (antidepressants)

Here's an exam-worthy detail: guided internet-delivered CBT works as well as face-to-face CBT for adults with social anxiety. This matters in the modern landscape of teletherapy and app-based interventions. For children and adolescents, school-based CBT shows beneficial effects—meeting kids where they are.

### Panic Disorder: The Alarm System Gone Haywire

Panic disorder requires recurrent unexpected panic attacks, with at least one followed by a month or more of worry about future attacks or maladaptive behavior changes because of attacks.

**A panic attack is defined as an abrupt surge of intense fear peaking within minutes, with at least four of 13 symptoms:**

| Physical Symptoms | Cognitive/Emotional Symptoms |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Heart palpitations | Fear of losing control or "going crazy" |
| Sweating | Fear of dying |
| Nausea or abdominal distress | Derealization or depersonalization |
| Dizziness | |
| Paresthesia (numbness/tingling) | |

**Critical diagnostic consideration:** Rule out medical conditions first. Hyperthyroidism, cardiac arrhythmia, and other medical issues can mimic panic attacks. This isn't just good clinical practice; it's a liability issue.

**Treatment involves panic control treatment**, a comprehensive CBT approach that includes interoceptive exposure—deliberately inducing physical panic sensations (running in place, spinning, breathing through a straw) to help patients learn these sensations aren't dangerous. It's counterintuitive but effective: instead of avoiding the sensations, you run toward them until they lose their power.

Medications (certain antidepressants and benzodiazepines) can help, but they have high relapse rates when used alone. The exam wants you to know that psychological interventions should be primary.

### Agoraphobia: It's Not Just Fear of Open Spaces

Common misconception: agoraphobia means fear of open spaces. More accurate: fear of situations where escape might be difficult or help unavailable if panic symptoms or other embarrassing symptoms occur.

**Diagnosis requires marked fear or anxiety in at least two of five situations:**
- Using public transportation
- Being in open spaces
- Being in enclosed spaces
- Standing in line or being in a crowd
- Being outside the home alone

Duration: typically six months minimum. The person must actively avoid these situations, require a companion, or endure them with intense distress.

Picture someone whose world gradually shrinks. First, they avoid the subway. Then crowded stores. Then they need their partner to come with them everywhere. Eventually, they're homebound. That's the progression agoraphobia can take without treatment.

**Treatment: In vivo exposure and response prevention**, typically graded but intense (non-graded) exposure also works and may have better long-term effects. Here's a counterintuitive finding: adding relaxation, breathing retraining, or cognitive techniques doesn't significantly improve outcomes. The active ingredient appears to be learning to tolerate high anxiety levels. It's not about feeling comfortable; it's about functioning despite discomfort.

### Generalized Anxiety Disorder: The Worry Machine

GAD involves excessive anxiety and worry about multiple events or activities on most days for at least six months. The person finds it difficult to control the worry, and symptoms include at least three of six (one for children): restlessness, fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance.

**What distinguishes GAD from normal worry?** Three things:
1. Feeling unable to control it
2. Worrying about more things
3. More somatic symptoms

The content of worries changes across the lifespan. Kids worry about catastrophic events and competence in sports and school. Older adults worry about health and safety. This developmental perspective helps you contextualize symptoms.

**Three theories explain why people with GAD worry so much:**

**Cognitive Avoidance Theory (Borkovec):** Worry is verbal-linguistic and creates low mental imagery. This helps people avoid more distressing mental pictures and the emotions that come with them. Patients often report that worry prevents even worse thoughts.

**Contrast Avoidance Model (Newman & Llera):** People with GAD maintain chronic negative emotion through worry to avoid sudden emotional shifts. Think of it like this: If you're already expecting disaster, actual bad news doesn't hit as hard. Research shows people with GAD are more disturbed by emotional contrasts than others.

**Intolerance of Uncertainty Model (Dugas):** This model identifies four factors that characterize GAD worry:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Intolerance of uncertainty | Low tolerance for ambiguity and strong reactions to it |
| Negative problem orientation | Poor confidence and ability in problem-solving, especially with uncertainty |
| Positive beliefs about worry | Believing worry prevents bad things or distracts from worse thoughts |
| Cognitive avoidance | Using strategies to avoid threatening mental images |

This model has strong research support for distinguishing GAD from other anxiety disorders.

**Brain findings:** GAD shows reduced connectivity between prefrontal/anterior cingulate regions and the amygdala, suggesting weak top-down control of amygdala reactivity. The thinking brain can't properly regulate the emotion brain.

**Treatment typically involves CBT and/or medication.** Some studies find CBT alone or CBT plus medication beats medication alone. Interesting add-on: motivational interviewing as a pretreatment to CBT reduces resistance and improves outcomes. This makes sense—if someone believes their worry serves a protective function, you need to address that ambivalence before jumping into exposure.

**Medications:** SSRIs and SNRIs are first-line. Buspirone can augment partially effective antidepressants. Benzodiazepines provide short-term acute relief but aren't good long-term solutions due to tolerance and dependence risks.

## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: More Than Just Being Neat

OCD moved to its own category in DSM-5, grouped with body dysmorphic disorder and related conditions that share symptoms, comorbidity patterns, and treatment response.

**Core features:** Recurrent obsessions and/or compulsions that take more than an hour daily or cause significant distress or impairment.

- **Obsessions:** Intrusive, unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that cause anxiety or distress. The person tries to ignore or suppress them.
- **Compulsions:** Repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety or prevent a feared outcome, but they're excessive or unrealistically connected to their goal.

Common pattern: Obsession triggers anxiety, compulsion temporarily reduces it, cycle repeats. It's negatively reinforcing, just like phobic avoidance.

**Demographics:** Males have earlier onset, so slightly higher childhood prevalence. Females have slightly higher adult prevalence. Most common comorbidity: anxiety disorders.

**Genetics matter:** Heritability estimates run 27-57% for adults, 45-65% for children. Concordance rates show 57% for identical twins versus 22% for fraternal twins.

**Brain abnormalities center on the CSTC pathway** (cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical)—a circuit linking the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and amygdala. This pathway controls movement execution, habit formation, and reward. In OCD, it shows hyperactivity—like a loop that keeps running without a proper off switch.

**Treatment: Exposure and response prevention (ERP)**, alone or within CBT. For OCD, it's also called exposure with ritual prevention. You expose patients to anxiety-triggering thoughts, objects, or situations while preventing ritualistic behaviors.

Example: Someone obsessed with contamination touches a "dirty" doorknob (exposure) but doesn't wash their hands (response prevention). Anxiety spikes initially, then gradually decreases as they learn nothing terrible happens.

**SSRIs are also first-line treatment.** Research on combined treatment (ERP plus SSRI) suggests it's most effective when:
- Either alone has been ineffective
- Symptoms are severe
- Comorbid symptoms respond to antidepressants

The combo isn't always necessary, but knowing when it helps is clinically important.

**Additional findings:** Adding motivational interviewing before CBT with ERP may improve outcomes. For children and adolescents, in-person and telehealth ERP are equally effective, and ERP alone or ERP plus SSRI beats SSRI alone.

### Body Dysmorphic Disorder: When Mirror Checking Becomes Pathological

BDD involves preoccupation with a perceived physical defect that's not observable or appears minor to others. The person must have performed repetitive behaviors or mental acts (mirror checking, skin picking, comparing appearance to others) at some point, and the preoccupation must cause significant distress or impairment.

**Key feature:** Many have ideas or delusions of reference—believing others are mocking or taking special notice of their appearance. This can reach delusional intensity, but it's still BDD, not a psychotic disorder.

People with BDD frequently seek cosmetic procedures, and surgeons should screen for this condition because fixing the "flaw" doesn't resolve the underlying disorder. The preoccupation just shifts to something else.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Panic attacks and panic disorder are the same thing."** Not quite. Panic attacks occur in many conditions (and even in people without any disorder). Panic disorder specifically requires recurrent unexpected attacks plus persistent worry about future attacks or maladaptive behavioral changes.

**"Agoraphobia means fear of open spaces."** This oversimplifies it. It's fear of situations where escape is difficult or help unavailable if panic or embarrassing symptoms occur. Can include open spaces, but also enclosed spaces, crowds, public transportation, etc.

**"OCD is just being really organized and neat."** OCD involves genuine distress and functional impairment from intrusive thoughts and time-consuming rituals. Preferring organization doesn't equal pathology.

**"Relaxation training is essential for treating phobias and agoraphobia."** Research suggests the active ingredient in exposure therapy is learning to tolerate high anxiety, not reducing it through relaxation. Adding relaxation doesn't significantly improve outcomes.

**"You should always combine multiple techniques in anxiety treatment."** Sometimes less is more. For specific phobias and agoraphobia, well-executed exposure alone often outperforms exposure plus other ingredients.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**Duration rules:** Create a simple chart. Most anxiety disorders require six months duration. Separation anxiety allows four weeks for children/adolescents but six months for adults. GAD explicitly states six months in the criteria.

**Phobia subtypes:** Use the mnemonic ANBSO—Animal, Natural environment, Blood-injection-injury, Situational, Other.

**Panic attack symptoms (need 4 of 13):** Group them mentally—Cardiovascular (palpitations), Respiratory (shortness of breath), GI (nausea), Neuro (dizziness, paresthesia), Cognitive (fear of dying, fear of losing control, derealization/depersonalization), and General (sweating). This categorization helps recall.

**Treatment hierarchies:** For EPPP purposes, know the first-line treatments:
- Specific phobia: ERP (especially in vivo)
- Social anxiety: CBT and/or SSRIs/SNRIs
- Panic disorder: CBT (panic control treatment); medications have high relapse rates alone
- Agoraphobia: In vivo ERP
- GAD: CBT and/or SSRIs/SNRIs
- OCD: ERP (with or without CBT) and/or SSRIs

**Brain areas in anxiety:** The amygdala keeps coming up—it's the alarm system. Prefrontal regions regulate it. When anxiety disorders show brain patterns, it's usually overactive amygdala or underactive regulatory regions (or reduced connectivity between them).

**Genetics numbers:** You don't need to memorize exact percentages, but know that heritability for anxiety disorders generally ranges 30-50%, supporting a genetic component that's significant but not deterministic.

## Key Takeaways

- **Anxiety disorders share excessive fear and behavioral avoidance** but differ in triggers and focus. Duration is typically six months (except separation anxiety in children: four weeks).

- **Three-question diagnostic framework:** Is fear out of proportion? Has it lasted long enough? Does it significantly impair functioning?

- **Risk factors cluster around three areas:** stressful life events, behavioral inhibition temperament, and family history (especially anxious parents).

- **Separation anxiety** requires three of eight symptoms and specifically involves fear of separation from attachment figures. Treatment is CBT, enhanced by parent training for children.

- **Specific phobia treatment is exposure and response prevention**, with in vivo exposure superior to imaginal, and virtual reality showing promise for some phobia types. Blood-injection-injury subtype uniquely requires applied tension due to fainting response.

- **Mowrer's two-factor theory** explains phobia maintenance through classical conditioning (fear acquisition) and operant conditioning (avoidance negatively reinforced).

- **Social anxiety disorder** involves fear of scrutiny in social situations. Both CBT and SSRIs/SNRIs are first-line, and internet-delivered CBT equals face-to-face effectiveness.

- **Panic disorder** requires recurrent unexpected attacks plus persistent concern or behavioral change. Treatment is comprehensive CBT with interoceptive exposure.

- **Agoraphobia** involves fear in at least two of five situation types (transportation, open spaces, enclosed spaces, crowds/lines, being outside home alone). Key treatment is in vivo exposure; adding relaxation doesn't improve outcomes.

- **GAD** features excessive worry about multiple events most days for six months, difficult to control, with at least three of six associated symptoms. Three theories (cognitive avoidance, contrast avoidance, intolerance of uncertainty) explain the worry function.

- **OCD** involves obsessions (intrusive unwanted thoughts) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors/mental acts) consuming over an hour daily. Treatment is ERP and/or SSRIs, with combination most effective for severe cases or when either alone fails.

- **Brain findings consistently show** amygdala hyperactivity and prefrontal hypoactivity or reduced connectivity in anxiety disorders. OCD specifically involves hyperactivity in the CSTC pathway.

- **Genetic component is moderate** across anxiety disorders (30-50% heritability), with concordance rates for identical twins roughly double those of fraternal twins.

- **Body dysmorphic disorder** involves preoccupation with perceived appearance flaws not observable or minor to others, with repetitive checking behaviors and often ideas of reference.
