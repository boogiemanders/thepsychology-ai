## Why These Disorders Matter: When Life's Events Leave Their Mark

Picture this: You're scrolling through your social media feed, and someone shares a meme about "dissociating during a boring meeting." Your friend mentions their cousin who "has PTSD from their last relationship." A celebrity talks about their "somatic symptoms from stress." These terms get thrown around constantly in modern culture, but as future psychologists, you need to know exactly what they mean—and what they don't mean.

This cluster of disorders—trauma-related, dissociative, and somatic symptom disorders—represents something fundamental about human psychology: the many ways our minds and bodies respond when something goes seriously wrong. Whether it's surviving a car accident, experiencing childhood neglect, or dealing with unexplained physical symptoms, these disorders show us how psychological distress can manifest in dramatically different ways.

For the EPPP, this isn't just about memorizing symptoms. You need to understand how these disorders relate to each other, how to distinguish similar presentations, and what treatments actually work. Let's break it down in a way that sticks.

## The Trauma Family: When Bad Things Happen and Won't Let Go

All trauma-related disorders share one critical feature: exposure to a traumatic or stressful event is required for diagnosis. Think of trauma exposure as the entry ticket—without it, you can't diagnose these disorders, no matter how similar the symptoms might look.

### The Early Years: When Caregiving Goes Wrong

**Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)** and **Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED)** are like opposite responses to the same terrible situation: severe neglect in early childhood. 

Imagine a child's emotional development as building a relationship app. In healthy development, the app gets programmed with the basic code: "When I'm upset, I go to my caregiver. They help me feel better. This is how relationships work." But when a child experiences extreme insufficient care—think orphanages with minimal staff, severe neglect, or constantly rotating caregivers—the app either never gets properly coded or gets corrupted.

**RAD is the "shut down" response.** These kids don't seek comfort when distressed because their experience taught them that seeking comfort doesn't work. By age five or earlier, they've learned to withdraw emotionally. They show minimal positive emotion, limited responsiveness to others, and may display unexplained sadness or irritability with caregivers. The developmental age must be at least nine months because that's when attachment behaviors typically begin.

**DSED is the "indiscriminate" response.** Instead of shutting down, these kids act like every adult is potentially their caregiver. They'll approach strangers without hesitation, act overly familiar with people they just met, wander off without checking back with their actual caregivers, and might leave with strangers readily. It's like their relationship app defaulted to "trust everyone" because they never learned which specific people are safe.

Both require a history of extreme insufficient care that's believed responsible for the symptoms, but here's what's crucial: these are distinct disorders with different presentations, not just variations of the same problem.

### PTSD: When Your Alarm System Won't Turn Off

**Posttraumatic Stress Disorder** is probably the most well-known disorder in this category, and also one of the most misunderstood. The trauma requirement is specific: exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. This can happen through direct experience, witnessing it happen to others, learning it happened to a close friend or family member, or repeated exposure to traumatic details (like first responders seeing accident scenes regularly).

Your brain's threat detection system is like a home security system. In PTSD, it's as if the alarm experienced a major break-in and now it can't recalibrate. The system becomes hyperactive—detecting threats everywhere, sounding false alarms constantly, and keeping you in a permanent state of vigilance.

The brain changes are fascinating and important for the exam:

| Brain Region | Normal Function | In PTSD | Result |
|-------------|----------------|---------|---------|
| Amygdala | Threat detection | Hyperactive | Overreacts to potential threats |
| Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex | Rational thinking; inhibits amygdala | Hypoactive | Can't calm down the amygdala |
| Anterior Cingulate Cortex | Regulates emotions | Hyperactive | Heightened emotional reactivity |
| Hippocampus | Memory processing | Reduced volume; activity varies | Difficulty processing trauma memories |

The ventromedial prefrontal cortex normally acts like a manager telling the amygdala to calm down when there's no real threat. In PTSD, this manager is essentially offline, so the amygdala runs wild. Neurotransmitters are also dysregulated: increased dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate (ramping up the system), and decreased serotonin and GABA (which normally calm things down).

PTSD symptoms fall into four categories, and you need to remember all of them:

1. **Intrusion symptoms**: Unwanted memories, nightmares, flashbacks—the trauma keeps replaying
2. **Avoidance**: Steering clear of trauma reminders (people, places, conversations, thoughts)
3. **Negative changes in mood or cognition**: Can't remember parts of the trauma, persistent negative beliefs, detachment from others, inability to feel positive emotions
4. **Alterations in arousal and reactivity**: Irritability, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, concentration problems, sleep disturbances

Symptoms must last more than one month (this distinguishes it from Acute Stress Disorder) and cause significant distress or functional impairment.

#### Who's at Higher Risk?

Certain pre-trauma factors increase PTSD risk: prior trauma exposure, existing psychiatric disorders, high negative emotionality, being female, lower education and socioeconomic status, lack of social support, and exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination. It's like starting with a security system that's already had multiple false alarms—it's more likely to malfunction after a real break-in.

#### Treatment That Works

The APA guidelines are clear about what works best, and this hierarchy matters for the exam:

**First-line psychological treatments:**
- Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
- Prolonged Exposure (PE)
- Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

**Second-line psychological treatments:**
- Cognitive Therapy (CT)
- Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
- Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET)

**Pharmacological treatments:**
- No first-line medication recommendations
- Second-line: SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) and SNRI (venlafaxine)

Notice that medications are secondary—they help with depression and may reduce core symptoms, but they're not the primary recommendation.

For PTSD with comorbid substance use disorder, the approach has evolved. Traditionally, clinicians treated the substance use first, then addressed the PTSD. Think of it like fixing your car's engine before dealing with the transmission. But research showed this sequential approach doesn't work well—the disorders fuel each other. Now, integrated treatments that address both simultaneously are recommended, like COPE (Concurrent treatment of PTSD and substance use disorder using prolonged exposure).

One more critical point: **Single-session psychological debriefing doesn't work and may worsen symptoms.** Despite good intentions, having someone talk through their trauma immediately after it happens can actually make things worse. This is a common wrong answer on the exam.

For children and adolescents, **Trauma-Focused CBT (TF-CBT)** is the gold standard. Originally designed for sexual abuse survivors aged 3-18, it now treats various trauma types and includes family therapy components. It's effective not just for PTSD but also for depression, anxiety, and grief.

### Acute Stress Disorder: PTSD's Shorter Cousin

**Acute Stress Disorder** has similar requirements to PTSD—exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence—but different timing and symptoms. Symptoms must last between three days and one month. If symptoms persist beyond one month, the diagnosis changes to PTSD.

The symptom categories overlap with PTSD but are grouped differently: intrusion, negative mood, dissociative symptoms, avoidance, and arousal. The person needs at least nine symptoms from any of these categories. Think of Acute Stress Disorder as the early warning system—it catches people in that critical first month after trauma.

### Prolonged Grief Disorder: When Loss Doesn't Ease

This is the newest addition to the trauma-related family. **Prolonged Grief Disorder** recognizes that sometimes grief doesn't follow the expected trajectory. The death of someone close must have occurred at least 12 months ago for adults (6 months for children and adolescents).

The core features are intense yearning for the deceased person or preoccupation with thoughts about them, plus at least three of eight symptoms nearly every day for the past month: disbelief about the death, avoidance of reminders, emotional numbness, intense loneliness, and others.

This isn't just "really sad about someone dying." It's like being stuck in a loop where the grief is so consuming it prevents you from moving forward with life. The timeline is crucial—everyone grieves, but this diagnosis requires persistent, disabling symptoms beyond the typical mourning period.

## Dissociative Disorders: When the Mind Compartmentalizes

Dissociative disorders involve disruptions in consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, and perception. Think of your mental experience as a streaming service that integrates video, audio, and subtitles seamlessly. In dissociative disorders, these streams become disconnected or corrupted.

### Dissociative Amnesia: The Memory Gap

**Dissociative Amnesia** involves inability to recall important personal information that can't be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. This isn't "I forgot where I parked"—it's "I can't remember the last three days" or "I don't know how I got here."

The types of amnesia matter for the exam:

| Type | What's Forgotten | Example |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Localized (most common) | All events during a specific time period | Can't remember anything from the day of the assault |
| Selective | Some events during a specific time period | Remembers going to the party but not the attack itself |
| Generalized | Entire life history | Complete loss of identity and life memories |
| Systematized | Specific category of information | Can't remember anything about a particular person |
| Continuous | New events as they happen | Can't form new memories (very rare in dissociative amnesia) |

Dissociative fugue can be specified—this involves purposeful travel or wandering with memory loss. Imagine someone suddenly finding themselves in another city with no idea how they got there. It's often related to trauma or extreme stress.

### Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder: When Reality Feels Wrong

**Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder** involves feeling detached from yourself (depersonalization) or your surroundings (derealization). Crucially, reality testing remains intact—the person knows these feelings aren't real, which distinguishes this from psychotic disorders.

Depersonalization is like watching yourself in a movie—you feel like an observer of your own thoughts, feelings, or body. Derealization is like living in a simulation—people or objects seem unreal, dreamlike, or distant. These experiences must be persistent or recurrent and cause significant distress or impairment.

Many people experience brief episodes of these feelings, especially under stress or sleep deprivation. The disorder diagnosis requires that these experiences are frequent enough and distressing enough to interfere with functioning.

## Somatic Symptom Disorders: When the Body Speaks

These disorders involve physical symptoms or health concerns that cause significant distress or dysfunction. What makes them psychiatric disorders isn't that the symptoms are "fake"—they're real experiences—but that the person's thoughts, feelings, or behaviors about these symptoms are excessive or disproportionate.

### Somatic Symptom Disorder: Distress About Symptoms

**Somatic Symptom Disorder** requires one or more somatic symptoms that disrupt daily life, plus excessive thoughts, emotions, or behaviors about these symptoms. The "excessive" part is key—at least one of these must be present:

- Disproportionate thoughts about symptom seriousness
- Persistently high anxiety about health
- Excessive time and energy devoted to health concerns

Think of someone whose back pain dominates their entire life. They spend hours researching conditions online, see multiple specialists constantly, can't focus at work because they're worried about what the pain means, and become convinced they have a serious disease despite reassurance. The pain is real, but the psychological response is out of proportion.

The disorder can be specified as involving predominant pain, and as persistent if it's severe, causes marked impairment, and lasts over six months.

### Illness Anxiety Disorder: The Fear Takes Center Stage

**Illness Anxiety Disorder** is preoccupation with having a serious illness when there are no or only mild somatic symptoms. The anxiety about health is the primary issue, not physical symptoms themselves.

These individuals either engage in excessive health-related behaviors (constantly checking their body, researching diseases, seeking medical consultations) or avoid healthcare entirely (too afraid to go to the doctor). Symptoms must persist for at least six months, though the specific feared illness may change.

It's like having a virus scanner on your computer that constantly gives you false positives. Every minor sensation becomes a potential sign of serious disease, and the anxiety creates its own cycle of distress.

### Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder: When the Hardware Seems Fine

Also called **Conversion Disorder**, this involves symptoms affecting voluntary motor or sensory functioning that are incompatible with known neurological or medical conditions. Common presentations include paralysis, blindness, seizures, or loss of sensation.

The key word is "incompatible"—the symptoms don't match any recognized neurological pattern. Someone might have "blindness" but navigate obstacles perfectly, or "paralysis" that disappears during sleep.

**Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES)** are particularly important. They look like epileptic seizures behaviorally but lack the abnormal brain electrical activity. Video EEG simultaneously records brain activity and behavior—when someone has seizure-like movements but normal EEG patterns, it suggests PNES. This is a definitive diagnostic tool worth remembering for the exam.

Specifiers indicate symptom type, course (acute or persistent), and whether there's an identifiable psychological stressor.

### Factitious Disorder: The Deception Element

**Factitious Disorder** involves falsifying or inducing symptoms with associated deception. The person presents themselves as ill or impaired even without obvious external reward. This distinguishes it from malingering.

There are two types:
- **Imposed on self**: Person fakes or causes their own symptoms
- **Imposed on another**: Person causes symptoms in someone else (often a child)

Examples include taking medications to produce abnormal lab results, injecting substances to cause infections, or tampering with medical devices. The deception is central to the presentation.

### The Critical Distinction: Factitious Disorder vs. Malingering

This comparison appears on the EPPP regularly:

| Feature | Factitious Disorder | Malingering |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Motivation | No clear external reward; motivation often unconscious | Clear external reward (money, drugs, avoiding work/prison) |
| DSM-5-TR status | Mental disorder | "Other condition that may be a focus" (not a mental disorder) |
| Psychological understanding | Driven by psychological need to assume sick role | Rational decision based on circumstances |
| When to suspect | Dramatic presentations without external incentives | Legal context, uncooperative with evaluation, antisocial personality disorder |

For malingering, the **forced-choice method** is useful for detection. Present items with two or more alternatives (like true/false questions). Since random guessing yields 50% accuracy, consistently scoring below 50% suggests deliberately choosing wrong answers—evidence of malingering.

The **Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM)** specifically detects feigned memory loss using forced-choice format. Performance significantly below chance indicates malingering.

### Genuine vs. Feigned Memory Loss

This distinction is clinically important:

| Feature | Genuine Memory Loss | Feigned Memory Loss |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Onset/termination | Gradual and hazy | Often sudden |
| Memories during amnestic period | Often remember fragments | Claim complete blank |
| Belief about recovery | Think hints/clues will help | Less likely to believe hints will help |
| Test performance | Consistent with neurological pattern | Below chance on forced-choice; atypical patterns |

## Common Misconceptions That Trip Up Test-Takers

**Misconception 1: "PTSD can only happen to combat veterans."**
Reality: PTSD can result from any exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence. Car accidents, assaults, natural disasters, medical trauma—all qualify. Combat is one cause among many.

**Misconception 2: "Dissociation and psychosis are the same thing."**
Reality: In dissociative disorders, reality testing remains intact. The person knows their experiences feel weird or unreal. In psychosis, reality testing is impaired—the person believes their perceptions are accurate.

**Misconception 3: "Somatic symptom disorders mean the person is faking."**
Reality: The symptoms are real. What's excessive is the psychological response—the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors about the symptoms, not the symptoms themselves.

**Misconception 4: "You should always treat substance use before PTSD."**
Reality: Current best practice uses integrated treatments that address both simultaneously. Sequential treatment (SUD first, then PTSD) is outdated.

**Misconception 5: "Psychological debriefing after trauma helps prevent PTSD."**
Reality: Single-session psychological debriefing doesn't prevent PTSD and may worsen outcomes. This is a common wrong answer trap.

**Misconception 6: "RAD and DSED are just variations of the same problem."**
Reality: These are distinct disorders with opposite presentations. RAD involves withdrawal; DSED involves indiscriminate social engagement.

## Memory Aids for Exam Success

**For PTSD's four symptom clusters, remember "ICAN":**
- **I**ntrusion (memories, nightmares, flashbacks)
- **C**ognition/mood changes (negative thoughts, emotions)
- **A**voidance (of reminders)
- **N**ervous system arousal (hypervigilance, startle, irritability)

**For PTSD brain changes, think of a broken management system:**
- **Amygdala** = alarm (too loud)
- **Ventromedial prefrontal cortex** = manager (sleeping on job)
- Result: No one can turn off the alarm

**For dissociative amnesia types:**
- **L**ocalized = **L**ost a time period
- **S**elective = **S**ome memories missing
- **G**eneralized = **G**one completely (whole life)
- **S**ystematized = **S**pecific category
- **C**ontinuous = **C**an't form new ones

**For distinguishing factitious from malingering:**
Factitious = **Fake** for psychological reasons (no obvious reward)
Malingering = **Money** or **Motive** (clear external reward)

**For PTSD treatment hierarchy:**
First-line = **CPE** (Cognitive Processing therapy, Prolonged Exposure, trauma-focused CBT)
Second-line = **CEMENT** (Cognitive therapy, EMDR, Narrative Exposure therapy, Medications if needed)

## Key Takeaways: What You Must Remember

- **All trauma-related disorders require exposure to trauma/stress as a diagnostic criterion**—it's the defining feature of this category

- **PTSD requires symptoms lasting more than one month**; if less than one month, consider Acute Stress Disorder

- **PTSD's four symptom clusters** (intrusion, avoidance, negative mood/cognition changes, arousal alterations) must all be understood

- **Brain changes in PTSD**: hyperactive amygdala and anterior cingulate, hypoactive ventromedial prefrontal cortex, reduced hippocampal volume

- **PTSD treatment hierarchy**: First-line is psychological (CPT, PE, trauma-focused CBT); medications are second-line only

- **Integrated treatment for PTSD + substance use disorder** is now preferred over sequential treatment

- **RAD involves withdrawal; DSED involves indiscriminate social behavior**—they're opposite responses to severe early neglect

- **Dissociative disorders maintain intact reality testing**—this distinguishes them from psychotic disorders

- **Somatic symptom disorder isn't about fake symptoms**—it's about excessive psychological responses to real (or perceived) physical symptoms

- **Factitious disorder lacks obvious external reward; malingering has clear external motivation** (money, avoiding responsibility, drugs)

- **Forced-choice testing** can detect malingering when performance falls below chance levels

- **Video EEG distinguishes PNES from epileptic seizures** by showing normal brain activity during seizure-like behaviors

- **Single-session psychological debriefing doesn't prevent PTSD** and may worsen outcomes—important wrong answer trap

Understanding these disorders means recognizing how trauma, stress, and psychological distress can manifest through different pathways—some through intrusive memories and hyperarousal, some through disconnection from memory or identity, and some through physical symptoms and health concerns. For the EPPP, focus on distinguishing features, required timelines, brain mechanisms for PTSD, and evidence-based treatments. These details matter, and mastering them will serve you well on exam day and in practice.
