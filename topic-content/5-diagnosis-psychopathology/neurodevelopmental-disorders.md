## Understanding Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Your EPPP Study Guide

Think back to learning a new piece of software at work. Some people pick it up immediately, while others need extra training time. Some struggle with specific features but excel at others. Now imagine if those differences weren't just about learning curves, but reflected how the brain developed from the very beginning. That's the foundation of neurodevelopmental disorders—differences in how the brain wires itself during early development that create lasting impacts on how people learn, communicate, and navigate the world.

For the EPPP, you'll need to distinguish between these disorders quickly and accurately. Let's break them down in a way that sticks.

## Why This Matters for Your Practice

Whether you end up in a school setting, private practice, or hospital, you'll encounter these disorders regularly. About 1 in 31 children has autism. ADHD is the most common diagnosed disorder among youth. Understanding these conditions means you can make accurate diagnoses, recommend effective treatments, and help families navigate what can feel like an overwhelming system. Plus, the EPPP loves testing your ability to differentiate between similar-sounding disorders and match symptoms to treatments.

## The Big Picture: What Makes Something "Neurodevelopmental"?

These disorders share three key features:
- They start early (usually before school age)
- They involve the brain developing differently, not being damaged later
- They affect functioning in multiple areas—personal, social, academic, or work life

Think of typical development like following a recipe. Neurodevelopmental disorders are like having different ingredients or following steps in a different order. The end result works differently, not necessarily worse—just differently, and often in ways that require extra support.

## Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability)

This is what used to be called "mental retardation." The name changed, but the core concept remains: significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior.

### The Three Required Components

For this diagnosis, you need all three:

1. **Intellectual deficits**: Confirmed through standardized IQ testing (typically 2+ standard deviations below the mean—around 70 or below)
2. **Adaptive functioning deficits**: The person can't meet age-appropriate standards for independence and social responsibility
3. **Onset during development**: Started during childhood or adolescence

Here's what trips up many students: The diagnosis isn't just about IQ scores. Someone could theoretically score low on an IQ test but function well in daily life (unlikely but possible), and they wouldn't receive this diagnosis. Conversely, adaptive functioning is what determines severity levels—not the IQ score itself.

### Severity Levels and What They Mean

| Severity | What This Looks Like |
|----------|---------------------|
| Mild | May live independently with some support; can work; might need help with complex tasks like healthcare decisions or financial planning |
| Moderate | Needs consistent support for daily activities; can work in supported settings; typically lives with family or in supervised housing |
| Severe | Requires daily supervision; limited communication; may participate in simple self-care with assistance |
| Profound | Needs 24/7 care; very limited communication; requires help with all aspects of daily living |

### The Causes You Need to Know

Here's a practical breakdown for the exam:

- **Known causes**: Only 25-50% of cases
- **Prenatal factors**: 80-85% of known causes (chromosomal issues, genetic disorders, prenatal exposure to alcohol or drugs)
- **Perinatal factors**: 5-10% (birth complications, asphyxia)
- **Postnatal factors**: 5-10% (traumatic brain injury, infections)

**Exam Alert**: Know the difference between Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome:
- **Down syndrome**: Chromosome-related (usually an extra chromosome 21); happens during cell division; not inherited
- **Fragile X syndrome**: Inherited genetic disorder; mutated gene on X chromosome; most common inherited cause of intellectual disability

Think of Down syndrome like a copy-paste error when duplicating a document—the error happens during the copying process. Fragile X is like having a corrupted file that gets passed from computer to computer.

## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

ASD has gone through several name changes and classification updates. The current DSM-5-TR combines what used to be separate diagnoses (autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder) into one spectrum.

### The Two Core Features

You need **both** of these for diagnosis:

**1. Social Communication and Interaction Deficits**

This includes:
- Reduced social-emotional reciprocity (like having a conversation where one person never asks questions back or shares their own experiences)
- Problems with nonverbal communication (unusual eye contact, not using gestures, flat facial expressions)
- Difficulty with relationships (trouble making friends, seeming uninterested in others, not adjusting behavior to fit different social situations)

**2. Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors, Interests, or Activities**

At least two of these:
- Stereotyped movements or speech (hand flapping, echolalia, lining up toys)
- Insistence on sameness (distress over small changes in routine, rigid thinking patterns)
- Highly restricted, intense interests (knowing everything about train schedules but nothing about age-typical topics)
- Unusual sensory responses (covering ears at normal sounds, seeking or avoiding certain textures)

### The Numbers You Should Know

- **Global prevalence**: About 1%
- **U.S. prevalence in children**: 3.2% (roughly 1 in 31 kids age 8)
- **U.S. prevalence in adults**: 2.2% (1 in 45)
- **Gender ratio**: 3-4 males for every 1 female

### What Predicts Better Outcomes?

Remember these three factors for the exam:
- IQ over 70
- Functional language by age 5
- Absence of other mental health problems

Think of these as protective factors—like having insurance, savings, and a stable job when facing economic uncertainty. Each one helps, and having all three provides the best cushion.

### The Brain and Biology

Several findings consistently show up on exams:

**Brain structure**:
- Accelerated brain growth starting around 6 months (larger head circumference and brain volume)
- Growth plateaus by preschool years
- Abnormalities in the cerebellum, corpus callosum, and amygdala

**Neurotransmitters**:
- Lower serotonin in the brain
- Higher serotonin in the blood
- Why? Blood serotonin may enter the fetal brain before the blood-brain barrier fully develops, damaging serotonin-producing neurons

**Genetics and environment**:
- Heritability estimate: About 62%
- Monozygotic twin concordance: 59-84%
- Dizygotic twin concordance: 3.5-29%
- Risk factors: Extreme prematurity (before 26 weeks), prenatal exposure to valproic acid, advanced parental age

**Exam Alert**: Despite extensive research, there's NO established link between childhood vaccinations and autism. If you see this on a practice question, it's a distractor.

### Treatment Approaches

| Treatment Type | What It Is | What Works Best |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI) | Uses applied behavior analysis (ABA); Lovaas method = 40+ hours/week | Greatest impact on intelligence and language; smaller impact on adaptive skills and core symptoms |
| Medication | Addresses co-occurring conditions and associated behaviors | Psychostimulants for ADHD symptoms; SSRIs for depression/anxiety; Atypical antipsychotics (risperidone, aripiprazole) for aggression and irritability |

Important: No medication treats the core symptoms of autism itself—only associated problems.

## Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

ADHD is the most prevalent diagnosed disorder among kids ages 3-17 in the U.S. You'll absolutely see questions about this on the EPPP.

### Diagnostic Requirements

The person needs a persistent pattern (at least 6 months) of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that:
- Started before age 12
- Occurs in at least 2 settings (like home and work, or school and social situations)
- Interferes with functioning

**Number of symptoms required**:
- Age 16 and under: At least 6 symptoms
- Age 17 and older: At least 5 symptoms

### The Three Presentations

| Presentation | What You See |
|--------------|-------------|
| Predominantly Inattentive | Doesn't listen when spoken to, loses things, forgetful, doesn't follow through, easily distracted |
| Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive | Can't sit still, talks excessively, interrupts others, runs/climbs inappropriately, acts without thinking |
| Combined | Meets criteria for both categories |

### How ADHD Changes with Age

Here's something the EPPP loves to test—symptoms look different in adults:

**Childhood hyperactivity** → **Adult restlessness, inability to relax**

Picture a child running around the classroom constantly. That same person as an adult feels internally restless, fidgets during meetings, can't watch a full movie without getting up multiple times.

**Childhood impulsivity** → **Adult reckless decisions**

The kid who blurts out answers becomes an adult who quits jobs suddenly, makes impulsive purchases, speeds while driving, or ends relationships abruptly.

**Inattention** → **Stays relatively stable**

This symptom persists most consistently. Adults miss deadlines, make careless errors, procrastinate, and struggle most with boring or repetitive tasks. Novel or interesting work? They're fine. Routine paperwork? Disaster.

### Comorbidity Alert

**Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)** is the most common comorbid condition with ADHD. About half of children with combined presentation also have ODD. The EPPP may give you a case study with both—make sure you can identify each disorder's symptoms separately.

### The Biology of ADHD

**Brain regions affected**:
- Prefrontal cortex: Executive functioning issues
- Striatum (caudate and putamen): Response inhibition problems
- Cerebellum: Temporal processing difficulties
- Amygdala: Emotion dysregulation

**Brain structure**: Children with ADHD typically have reduced total brain volume with smaller-than-normal prefrontal cortex, striatum, corpus callosum, and cerebellum.

**Neurotransmitters**: Low dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, leading to impaired impulse control, attention, and executive functioning.

**Genetics**: 
- Heritability: About 74%
- Monozygotic twin concordance: 62.8-79.3%
- Dizygotic twin concordance: 21.2-39%

### Treatment by Age Group

This is high-yield information for the exam:

| Age Group | Recommended Treatment |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Preschool | Behavioral interventions first (especially parent training in behavioral management). Medication only if behavioral interventions don't work. |
| Elementary/Middle School | Combination of medication + behavioral interventions at home and school |
| Adolescents | Medication with patient assent + behavioral interventions when available |
| Adults | Medication is first-line; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has strongest psychosocial support |

**Exam Alert**: Treating ADHD with stimulants in childhood does NOT increase or decrease the risk for later substance use disorders. The risk comes from having ADHD itself, not the treatment.

## Tic Disorders

Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic movements or vocalizations. Think of them like a sneeze—involuntary and hard to suppress, though the person might feel an urge building before it happens.

### The Three Tic Disorders

| Disorder | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| Tourette's Disorder | Multiple motor tics + at least one vocal tic; persisted >1 year; onset before age 18 |
| Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder | Motor OR vocal tics (not both types required); persisted >1 year; onset before age 18 |
| Provisional Tic Disorder | Motor and/or vocal tics; present <1 year; onset before age 18 |

### Key Facts

- Typical onset: 4-6 years old
- Peak severity: 10-12 years old
- Most common comorbidity: ADHD
- Biology: Dopamine overactivity, smaller caudate nucleus, genetic component
- Treatment: Antipsychotics (like haloperidol); Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT), which includes habit reversal training

**Memory Tip**: Tourette's requires BOTH motor and vocal tics. Think "Tour-TWO-ettes" = two types of tics.

## Communication Disorders: Focus on Stuttering

Childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) involves disrupted speech fluency inappropriate for age and language skills. 

**Symptoms include**:
- Sound/syllable repetitions ("b-b-b-ball")
- Sound prolongations ("sssssnake")
- Broken words (pauses within words)
- Blocking (stopping mid-word)
- Circumlocutions (talking around words they can't say)
- Excessive physical tension when speaking

**Key facts**:
- Onset: Usually 2-7 years old
- Recovery: 65-85% of children recover naturally
- Predictor: Severity at age 8 predicts whether it'll persist
- Treatment: Habit reversal training with regulated breathing as the competing response

## Specific Learning Disorder

This diagnosis requires academic difficulties lasting at least 6 months despite targeted interventions.

### The Six Possible Symptoms (Need at Least One)

1. Inaccurate or slow, effortful word reading
2. Difficulty understanding what's read
3. Spelling difficulties
4. Written expression difficulties
5. Problems with numbers (sense, facts, calculation)
6. Mathematical reasoning difficulties

### Additional Requirements

- Skills substantially below age expectations
- Interferes with academic/occupational performance or daily activities
- Onset during school-age years
- Not better explained by another condition

### The Numbers

- Prevalence: 5-15% of school-age children
- About 80% have reading disorders
- Most common reading disorder: **Dyslexia**
- Most common type of dyslexia: **Dysphonic (phonological) dyslexia**—difficulty connecting sounds to letters

**Exam Alert**: People with specific learning disorders typically have average to above-average IQ. That's part of what makes it a "specific" learning disorder—their general intelligence is intact, but they struggle with particular academic skills.

**Most common comorbidity**: ADHD

## Common Misconceptions

**"Autism is caused by vaccines."**
Wrong. Extensive research finds no link. This misconception persists in public discourse but is scientifically unfounded.

**"ADHD is overdiagnosed because kids are just being kids."**
While diagnostic practices vary, ADHD is a real neurodevelopmental disorder with biological underpinnings. The symptoms must cause significant impairment, occur across multiple settings, and be inappropriate for developmental level.

**"Intellectual disability is just about IQ scores."**
No. Adaptive functioning is equally important and actually determines severity level. Someone might test poorly but function well (unlikely), or test moderately but need extensive support.

**"People with autism don't want relationships."**
They often want social connections but struggle with the skills needed to form and maintain them. The desire is there; the execution is challenging.

**"ADHD medication leads to substance abuse."**
Research shows that stimulant treatment in childhood neither increases nor decreases future substance use risk. The risk comes from having ADHD itself.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**Use the "3-3-3 Rule" for major disorders**:
- Intellectual Disability: 3 criteria (intellectual deficits, adaptive deficits, developmental onset)
- ASD: 3 areas of social communication deficit, need at least 2 of 4 types of repetitive behaviors
- ADHD: 3 presentations (inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, combined)

**Create a tic disorders flowchart**:
- Does it involve both motor AND vocal tics lasting >1 year? → Tourette's
- Just one type (motor OR vocal) lasting >1 year? → Persistent
- Less than a year? → Provisional

**Remember prevalence with real numbers**:
- U.S. autism: "1 in 31 kids" sticks better than "3.2%"
- Down syndrome: Most common chromosomal cause of intellectual disability
- Fragile X: Most common inherited cause

**Age-based treatment for ADHD**:
"Young kids need behavior training; school-age kids need both pills and skills; teens and adults take pills primarily."

**Dyslexia types**:
"Dysphonic/phonological is most common—problems with PHONEs (sounds)."

## Key Takeaways

- **Neurodevelopmental disorders begin early in development** and affect personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning across multiple settings.

- **Intellectual Disability requires three components**: intellectual deficits (IQ testing), adaptive functioning deficits, and developmental onset. Severity is based on adaptive functioning, not IQ scores.

- **ASD requires both social communication deficits AND restricted/repetitive behaviors**. Better prognosis comes with IQ >70, language by age 5, and no comorbid mental health issues. No medication treats core symptoms; EIBI is the evidence-based intervention.

- **ADHD is the most common diagnosed disorder in youth** and requires symptoms in multiple settings, onset before age 12, and significant impairment. Symptoms change in adulthood but often persist. Treatment varies by age, with behavioral interventions preferred for preschoolers and medication commonly used for older individuals.

- **Tourette's disorder specifically requires both motor and vocal tics** lasting more than a year. ADHD is the most common comorbidity.

- **Specific Learning Disorder typically involves average to above-average IQ** with specific academic skill deficits. About 80% involve reading problems, with dysphonic dyslexia being most common. ADHD is the most frequent comorbid condition.

- **Know your genetics**: Heritability estimates are around 62% for ASD and 74% for ADHD. Twin studies show higher concordance in monozygotic than dizygotic twins, confirming genetic contributions while also showing environmental factors matter.

- **Treatment matches matter**: EIBI for autism, age-appropriate approaches for ADHD, CBIT for tics, habit reversal for stuttering. The EPPP loves matching interventions to conditions.

With this foundation, you're ready to tackle EPPP questions on neurodevelopmental disorders. Practice distinguishing between similar disorders, focus on diagnostic criteria and required number of symptoms, and remember that these conditions reflect different developmental trajectories—not deficits in character or effort.
