## Why These Therapies Still Matter for Your Practice

You're scrolling through your client list for tomorrow. Sarah, 32, struggles with relationships because she fears abandonment. Marcus, 28, feels stuck in a job that pays well but leaves him empty. Both need help, but which approach will serve them best?

Understanding psychodynamic and humanistic therapies isn't just about passing the EPPP—it's about having a complete toolkit. Even if you plan to practice cognitive-behavioral therapy, you'll encounter supervisors, colleagues, and clients who speak this language. More importantly, these approaches shaped modern psychology and still influence how we understand the therapeutic relationship, insight, and personal growth.

Let's break down these foundational approaches in ways that actually make sense.

## The Psychodynamic Perspective: Looking Under the Hood

Think of psychodynamic therapy like being a mechanic for the mind. When your check engine light comes on, the problem isn't usually what you see on the surface. A skilled mechanic looks at what's happening under the hood—systems interacting, old parts wearing down, pressure building up. Psychodynamic therapists do the same thing, except they're looking at unconscious conflicts instead of engine problems.

### Freudian Psychoanalysis: The Original Deep Dive

Freud had a pretty grim view of human nature—we're basically walking conflicts, managing competing demands every day. He proposed three parts of personality that are constantly negotiating:

**The Id, Ego, and Superego Triangle:**

| Personality Component | When It Develops | What It Wants | How It Operates |
|----------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Id | At birth | Immediate gratification of urges (sex, aggression) | Pleasure principle—"I want it NOW!" |
| Ego | Around 6 months | To satisfy the id realistically | Reality principle—"Let me figure out how to get this without consequences" |
| Superego | Later childhood | Perfect moral behavior | Conscience—"You shouldn't want that at all!" |

Imagine you're at a work conference. You see the last brownie on the dessert table. Your id screams "Grab it!" Your superego says "Someone else might want it—be selfless!" Your ego mediates: "I'll cut it in half and offer to share." That's personality in action.

When the ego can't handle the conflict between what we want and what's "right," it deploys defense mechanisms—mental shortcuts that protect us from anxiety but distort reality.

**Common Defense Mechanisms You'll See:**

- **Repression**: The foundation of all defense mechanisms. Your client can't remember being bullied in middle school, even though it clearly shaped their social anxiety. The memory's locked away in the unconscious.

- **Denial**: Your client's partner left three months ago, but they still set two places at the dinner table and talk about "we" instead of "I."

- **Reaction Formation**: Someone with strong attraction to a coworker becomes overly critical and cold toward them—expressing the opposite of what they really feel.

- **Projection**: A manager who feels incompetent constantly accuses their team of not being good enough. They're attributing their own feelings to others.

- **Sublimation**: Someone channels aggressive impulses into becoming a successful prosecuting attorney or competitive athlete. This is actually adaptive—turning unacceptable urges into something socially valuable.

Here's what you need to remember for the exam: Defense mechanisms aren't always bad. Using them occasionally is normal and even helpful. The problem arises when someone relies on them constantly, never actually resolving the underlying conflict.

### The Four Steps of Psychoanalytic Process

Psychoanalysts don't just let clients talk randomly. There's a method:

1. **Confrontation**: "I've noticed you change the subject every time we discuss your mother. Let's look at that."

2. **Clarification**: Separating what matters from what doesn't. "You've mentioned three different times she disappointed you. The common thread seems to be feeling invisible."

3. **Interpretation**: Connecting the dots. "Perhaps you pursue emotionally unavailable partners because that familiar feeling of being unseen is what you learned to expect from relationships."

4. **Working Through**: The long game. After multiple interpretations, the client experiences catharsis—feeling those repressed emotions—then gradually integrates new understanding into daily life.

### Jung's Analytical Psychology: Adding Positivity and Purpose

Jung started as Freud's protégé but eventually said, "This is too dark and deterministic." He added some important twists:

- Behavior is driven by positive forces too, not just sex and aggression
- Personality develops across your entire life, not just in childhood
- The future matters as much as the past—where you're going influences your behavior now

Jung split the unconscious into two parts. The **personal unconscious** is your own stuff—your repressed memories, forgotten experiences. The **collective unconscious** is shared by all humans—universal patterns passed down through generations, like mental software we all inherit.

These universal patterns are called **archetypes**. Think of them as psychological templates: the Hero, the Shadow (our dark side), the Persona (the mask we show the world), the Anima/Animus (feminine/masculine aspects in each person).

The goal of Jungian therapy is **individuation**—becoming your authentic, whole self. This typically happens in midlife when people stop trying to meet everyone else's expectations and ask, "Who am I really?"

## The Humanistic Perspective: You've Got This

If psychodynamic therapy is like being a mechanic looking under the hood, humanistic therapy is like being a personal trainer who believes you already have everything you need—you just need the right environment and support to access it.

### Person-Centered Therapy: Creating the Right Conditions

Carl Rogers had radical faith in people. He believed everyone has an internal compass pointing toward growth and **self-actualization**—becoming your fullest, best self. So what blocks this natural process?

**Incongruence**—the gap between who you are and who you think you should be.

Picture it like this: Your authentic self loves art and wants to be a graphic designer. But you've been told "artists starve" so you became an accountant. Every day at work feels wrong. That's incongruence—your self-concept (responsible accountant) doesn't match your experience (unfulfilled creative person).

**Conditions of worth** create this gap. These are the strings attached to love and acceptance. "I'll approve of you IF you become a doctor." "I'll love you IF you're always agreeable." You internalize these conditions and start policing yourself.

Rogers believed the solution is surprisingly simple: provide the right therapeutic conditions, and people naturally heal. He identified three **facilitative conditions** (also called core conditions):

| Core Condition | What It Means | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| Empathy | Understanding the client's world as they experience it | "It sounds like you feel trapped—wanting to leave but terrified of disappointing everyone." |
| Unconditional Positive Regard | Accepting the client completely, without judgment | Valuing them even when they describe behaviors you personally find problematic |
| Congruence | Being genuine and authentic | Not hiding behind a professional mask; being real (within appropriate boundaries) |

For the EPPP, remember: Rogers didn't use techniques or interpretations. The relationship IS the therapy. No homework, no analyzing dreams, just genuine human connection that creates safety for growth.

### Gestalt Therapy: Staying Present and Aware

Gestalt therapy focuses on the here-and-now. Not "Why did this happen?" but "What are you experiencing right now?"

The core idea: We maintain **homeostasis** (balance), but needs constantly arise that disrupt it. When you're hungry, you seek food to restore balance. When you're lonely, you seek connection. Problems arise when there's a persistent **boundary disturbance**—a blurred line between you and the environment that keeps you from getting your needs met.

**Common Boundary Disturbances:**

- **Introjection**: Swallowing others' beliefs whole without questioning. "My parents said emotions are weakness" becomes your unexamined truth, even though it's causing you problems.

- **Projection**: Your client says "My boss hates me" when really they hate their boss but can't acknowledge it.

- **Retroflection**: Doing to yourself what you want to do to others. Instead of expressing anger at a friend, you develop stress headaches or engage in self-criticism.

- **Deflection**: Avoiding real contact. Someone jokes whenever conversation gets deep, or always asks about you to avoid discussing themselves.

- **Confluence**: No boundary at all. "We think..." instead of "I think..." Losing yourself in relationships or groups.

The magic word in Gestalt therapy is **awareness**. Once you're aware of what you're doing right now—how you're feeling, what you're avoiding—change becomes possible.

**Gestalt Techniques You'll Encounter:**

- **Empty chair**: Client talks to an empty chair representing their critical father, their younger self, or conflicting parts of themselves. This externalizes internal conflicts and makes them workable.

- **Dream work**: Unlike Freud's symbolic interpretation, Gestalt therapists have clients role-play parts of their dreams. "Be the locked door in your dream. What are you holding back?" Each element represents a disowned part of the client.

## Existential Therapy: Freedom, Responsibility, and Finding Meaning

Existential therapists tackle the big questions: What's the point? Why am I here? What happens when I die? These aren't just philosophical musings—they're practical issues that cause real anxiety.

### The Four Ultimate Concerns

Existential therapists believe psychological problems stem from inability to face four fundamental realities:

1. **Death**: We're all going to die, and we don't know when. This can paralyze us or motivate us to live fully.

2. **Freedom**: We're radically free to choose, which means we're also radically responsible for our choices. No one else made you stay in that relationship or job—you chose it.

3. **Isolation**: Despite connection, we're fundamentally alone in our own consciousness. No one can fully know your experience.

4. **Meaninglessness**: Life has no inherent meaning—we must create it ourselves.

These concerns create two types of anxiety:

**Normal (existential) anxiety** is proportionate to real threats. You're anxious about a medical diagnosis—that's appropriate. This anxiety can motivate positive action.

**Neurotic anxiety** is disproportionate and involves repression. You're paralyzed by fear of flying despite statistics showing it's safe. This anxiety keeps you from living fully.

The goal is helping clients live **authentically**—making choices based on their own values, not just drifting through life on autopilot or living someone else's script.

## Reality Therapy: Choose Responsibly

William Glasser created a more structured humanistic approach focused on choice and responsibility. He identified five basic needs: love and belonging, power, fun, freedom, and survival.

Here's the key: How you choose to meet these needs determines everything.

**Success identity**: Meeting needs in positive, responsible ways that don't violate others' rights. You need power, so you develop competence at work and earn respect.

**Failure identity**: Meeting needs in negative, destructive ways. You need power, so you control and manipulate others, which ultimately isolates you.

Reality therapists use the **WDEP system**:

- **W**ants: What do you want? What do you need?
- **D**oing: What are you currently doing?
- **E**valuation: Is what you're doing working? Is it getting you what you want?
- **P**lan: What will you do differently?

Notice there's no "Why?" Reality therapists don't care much about the past or unconscious motivations. They focus on current choices and future actions.

## Modern Approaches: Positive Psychology and Personal Constructs

### Positive Psychology: Science Meets Optimism

This is the newest kid on the block. Instead of asking "What's wrong with people?" positive psychology asks "What's right with people? What helps humans thrive?"

Key concept: **Flow**—being so absorbed in an activity that time disappears. You're coding, painting, or problem-solving, and suddenly three hours have passed. Flow happens when challenge and skill are balanced and both are high. Too easy = boredom. Too hard = anxiety. Just right = flow.

For the EPPP, know that positive psychology distinguishes itself by emphasizing scientific research. They're not just philosophizing—they're running studies showing that optimism extends lifespan and gratitude interventions improve depression.

### Personal Construct Therapy: Change How You See

George Kelly proposed that we all have **personal constructs**—bipolar dimensions we use to interpret events. Think of them as the filters through which you view reality: success/failure, trustworthy/untrustworthy, exciting/boring.

You're not stuck with your constructs. The same situation can be viewed through different constructs, producing different emotions and behaviors.

Your client views a canceled date through the construct "rejected/accepted." Result: devastation. The therapist helps them try an alternative construct: "respectful of my time/disrespectful of my time" or "compatible/incompatible." Same event, different meaning, different emotional response.

**Fixed-role therapy**: The client role-plays a fictional character (created by the therapist) who interprets events through different constructs. It's like trying on a new pair of glasses to see if the world looks different—and often it does.

## Key Differences You Need to Know

| Aspect | Psychodynamic | Humanistic/Existential |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| View of human nature | Deterministic, driven by unconscious conflicts | Optimistic, driven toward growth |
| Focus | Past experiences, unconscious material | Present experience, subjective reality |
| Therapist role | Expert analyst, interpreter | Facilitator, authentic partner |
| Goal | Make unconscious conscious, strengthen ego | Facilitate self-actualization, authentic living |
| Techniques | Interpretation, analysis of transference | Core conditions, awareness exercises |

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception 1**: "Psychodynamic therapy is just lying on a couch talking about your mother."

Reality: Modern psychodynamic therapy is evidence-based, time-limited in many forms, and addresses a wide range of issues beyond parental relationships.

**Misconception 2**: "Humanistic therapy is just being nice to people."

Reality: While empathy and acceptance are central, humanistic therapists actively work to increase awareness and facilitate growth. It's structured and intentional.

**Misconception 3**: "These old approaches aren't used anymore."

Reality: Psychodynamic and humanistic concepts influence nearly every therapy approach. The therapeutic relationship, insight, and awareness are foundational across orientations.

**Misconception 4**: "Defense mechanisms are bad."

Reality: They're adaptive in moderation. Problems arise from over-reliance, not occasional use.

**Misconception 5**: "Existential therapy is too philosophical for practical use."

Reality: Existential approaches effectively address anxiety, depression, life transitions, and meaning-related concerns—very practical issues.

## Memory Aids for the Exam

**For Freud's personality structure**: Think "IES" in order of development:
- **I**d = Infant (present at birth)
- **E**go = Early childhood (6 months)
- **S**uperego = School age (later)

**For defense mechanisms**: Remember "DR PRS" (Dr. Press):
- **D**enial
- **R**epression
- **P**rojection
- **R**eaction formation
- **S**ublimation

**For Rogers's core conditions**: "EUC" (like a tech conference):
- **E**mpathy
- **U**nconditional positive regard
- **C**ongruence

**For Gestalt boundary disturbances**: "I PRoDuCe":
- **I**ntrojection
- **P**rojection
- **R**etroflection
- **D**eflection
- **C**onfluence

**For existential concerns**: "DFIM" (Defy):
- **D**eath
- **F**reedom
- **I**solation
- **M**eaninglessness

**For reality therapy**: Just remember "WDEP" stands for wants, doing, evaluate, plan—straightforward and practical.

## Key Takeaways

- **Psychodynamic therapies** assume current problems stem from unconscious conflicts, typically rooted in childhood. The ego mediates between the id (pleasure) and superego (morality) using defense mechanisms when rational means fail.

- **Freudian psychoanalysis** uses free association, dream analysis, and interpretation to make the unconscious conscious through confrontation, clarification, interpretation, and working through.

- **Jungian analytical psychology** adds positive motivations, lifelong development, and the collective unconscious with its universal archetypes. The goal is individuation—becoming your whole, authentic self.

- **Person-centered therapy** trusts in self-actualization and provides empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence. The relationship itself is therapeutic—no techniques needed.

- **Gestalt therapy** emphasizes present awareness and addresses boundary disturbances (introjection, projection, retroflection, deflection, confluence) using techniques like empty chair and dream work.

- **Existential therapy** helps clients face ultimate concerns (death, freedom, isolation, meaninglessness) and live authentically despite existential anxiety.

- **Reality therapy** focuses on responsible choice and replacing failure identity with success identity using the WDEP system (wants, doing, evaluate, plan).

- **Positive psychology** scientifically studies what helps people thrive, emphasizing concepts like flow and building on strengths rather than just fixing problems.

- **Personal construct therapy** helps clients change maladaptive ways of interpreting events by trying out alternative constructs through techniques like fixed-role therapy.

These approaches may seem old-school, but they've shaped how every modern therapist thinks about the therapeutic relationship, insight, awareness, and human potential. Master these foundations, and you'll understand where contemporary approaches came from—and pass that section of the EPPP with confidence.
