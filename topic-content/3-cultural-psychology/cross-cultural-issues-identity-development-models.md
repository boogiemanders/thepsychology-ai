## Why Identity Development Models Matter for Your Practice

Picture your first week at a new job. You might find yourself trying to fit in, maybe downplaying parts of yourself that feel different. By month six, you're questioning whether you should speak up about things that bother you. A year later, you've found your groove – you know who you are in this space and can be authentic without losing professional credibility. This natural progression mirrors what many people experience as they develop their racial, cultural, and sexual identities.

For the EPPP, you need to know these identity development models cold. They show up frequently on the exam, and more importantly, they're essential for culturally competent practice. Each model maps the journey people take as they understand and integrate important aspects of their identity. Let's break down what you need to know.

## The Common Thread: From Rejection to Integration

Before we dive into specific models, here's the pattern that runs through almost all racial and cultural identity models: People typically start by either ignoring or rejecting their minority culture, then swing through various stages of awareness and sometimes anger, before landing at a place where they can appreciate their culture without rejecting others. Think of it like a pendulum that swings from one extreme ("my culture doesn't matter" or "the majority culture is better") to another extreme ("only my culture matters"), before settling in the middle ("my culture matters, and so do others").

This pattern makes intuitive sense. When you're surrounded by messages that your group isn't valued, you might initially try to distance yourself from it – like someone who changes their accent to sound more "professional" or anglicizes their name on job applications. Eventually, many people reach a breaking point where they reject those adaptations and reclaim their identity, sometimes strongly. The healthiest endpoint involves integration: knowing who you are, valuing that, and being able to engage meaningfully with people from all backgrounds.

## Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's R/CID Model: The Five-Stage Journey

This model applies to members of any racial or cultural minority group and tracks how they view three groups: their own minority group, other minority groups, and the majority group. Think of it as tracking someone's relationship status with different parts of society.

### The Five Stages Explained

| Stage | View of Own Group | View of Other Minorities | View of Majority | Therapy Preference |
|-------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Conformity | Negative/neutral | Negative/neutral | Positive | Majority therapist preferred |
| Dissonance | Questioning begins | Questioning begins | Questioning begins | Majority therapist okay if culturally aware |
| Resistance & Immersion | Positive | Conflicting | Negative | Own-group therapist strongly preferred |
| Introspection | Positive but questioning blind loyalty | Concerned about bias | More nuanced | Own-group therapist preferred but flexible |
| Integrative Awareness | Balanced view | Balanced view | Balanced view | Therapist similarity in worldview matters most |

**Conformity** is like being the new employee who agrees with everything the established team says, even when it goes against your values. People here accept negative stereotypes about their own group and see the majority culture as superior. If they come to therapy, they want a therapist from the majority group and feel threatened by attempts to explore their cultural identity. It's like if someone asked you about your family traditions and you immediately got defensive – "Why does that matter? I'm just like everyone else."

**Dissonance** hits when reality contradicts the narrative. Maybe you witness blatant discrimination, or you read something that opens your eyes to systemic issues. It's that uncomfortable moment when your Spotify algorithm plays music from your culture and you realize you've been avoiding it, and you're not sure why. People in this stage are curious and questioning. They might seek therapy and want a culturally aware therapist, even if from the majority group.

**Resistance and Immersion** is the swing to the other extreme. People here are all-in on their own culture and deeply suspicious of the majority group. They're like someone who just discovered they've been underpaid compared to colleagues and now questions everything their company does. They attribute psychological problems to racism (which often has validity) and typically won't seek therapy unless absolutely necessary. When they do, they want a therapist from their own group.

**Introspection** brings self-reflection. People start wondering if their fierce allegiance to their group is limiting their growth. They're secure in their cultural identity but also want to be seen as individuals. It's like when you love your tight-knit friend group but start realizing you need other perspectives too. They prefer own-group therapists but are open to others who truly get their worldview.

**Integrative Awareness** is the sweet spot. People can see the good and bad in all groups, including their own. They're comfortable with who they are and committed to fighting all forms of oppression. When choosing a therapist, they care more about shared values and worldview than demographics. They want therapy focused on creating societal change, not just individual adjustment.

## Cross's Black Racial Identity Development Model: Evolution of a Theory

This model has gone through more makeovers than most people's dating app profiles, which tells you something important: identity development theory is constantly being refined based on research and lived experience.

### The Original Five Stages (What Most Tests Still Reference)

**Pre-Encounter**: Idealizing White culture, viewing Black culture as a problem. Like someone who only dates outside their race because they've internalized negative messages about their own group.

**Encounter**: A wake-up moment – experiencing or witnessing racism that can't be explained away. Maybe it's being followed in a store, or watching a video of police brutality, or having your child come home from school asking why their hair is "wrong."

**Immersion-Emersion**: Total embrace of Black culture and rejection of White culture. Reading only Black authors, listening only to Black artists, wanting only Black friends. It's an important stage for learning and connecting.

**Internalization**: The intensity calms down. You have a solid Black identity and can tolerate differences. You're not defensive about your identity anymore.

**Internalization-Commitment**: Same as above but with active commitment to fighting oppression through social activism.

### The Modern Version

Cross later simplified this to three stages with subtypes, recognizing that identity is more complex than a simple linear path. The **Pre-Encounter** stage now includes different ways of relating to Blackness: assimilation (trying to fit in with White culture), miseducation (accepting false stereotypes), and self-hatred (actively rejecting Black identity). The **Immersion-Emersion** stage distinguishes between intense Black involvement (positive) and anti-White attitudes (negative). The **Internalization** stage recognizes different positive end states: Black nationalist, biculturalist, or multiculturalist.

## Sellers's Multidimensional Model: Identity Isn't a Straight Line

This is where things get really interesting and more realistic. Sellers and colleagues said, "Hold on – identity isn't just a stage you're in. It's more fluid and context-dependent." Think about how your professional identity might be front and center during a job interview but barely on your mind when you're at a concert with friends.

### The Four Dimensions

**Racial Salience** is how much your race matters to you *right now, in this moment*. Walking into a party where you're the only Black person? Salience just shot up. Having coffee with your Black best friend? Might be low. It's situational, like how you're more aware of being a driver when you see police lights behind you.

**Racial Centrality** is how important race is to your overall identity, regardless of the situation. It's stable across contexts. For some people, race is core to who they are, always. For others, it's less central than gender, religion, or profession. Neither is right or wrong – it's individual.

**Racial Regard** has two parts. *Private regard* is how you feel about being Black and about Black people generally. *Public regard* is how you think others view Black people. These don't have to match. You might have high private regard (pride in your identity) but low public regard (awareness that society devalues your group). Like knowing you're great at your job but also knowing your industry has biases against people like you.

**Racial Ideology** is your belief system about how Black people should operate in society. It comes in four flavors:

- **Nationalist**: Black people should control their own destiny, build their own institutions, center Black interests
- **Oppressed Minority**: Coalition-building with other marginalized groups who share similar experiences
- **Assimilationist**: Work within the system, emphasize similarities with mainstream America
- **Humanist**: Focus on universal human concerns, race has low centrality

The genius of this model is recognizing that someone might hold different ideologies depending on context. You might think Black people should support Black-owned businesses (nationalist) while also believing in integrated schools (assimilationist). You contain multitudes.

## Helms's White Racial Identity Development: The Majority Culture Journey

This model is crucial because it applies to the majority of psychologists in the U.S. If you're White, this is your roadmap. If you're not, this helps you understand the White clients and colleagues you'll work with.

### Two Phases, Six Statuses

The first phase is about abandoning racism. The second is about building a positive White identity that isn't based on superiority.

| Status | What's Happening | Information Processing Strategy | Key Feature |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| Contact | Unaware of racism, satisfied with status quo | Obliviousness | "I don't see color" |
| Disintegration | Aware of contradictions, moral confusion | Suppression and ambivalence | Cognitive dissonance and anxiety |
| Reintegration | Resolving discomfort by blaming minorities | Selective perception and distortion | "They bring it on themselves" |
| Pseudo-Independence | Intellectual acceptance without real change | Reshaping reality, selective perception | Performative allyship |
| Immersion-Emersion | Searching for meaning of Whiteness | Hypervigilance and reshaping | Active self-examination |
| Autonomy | Nonracist identity, values diversity | Flexibility and complexity | Genuine multicultural competence |

**Contact** is that friend who says "I don't see race, I just see people" and means it as a compliment. They've had limited meaningful contact with people of color and genuinely don't understand systemic racism. They think the playing field is level.

**Disintegration** happens when reality intrudes. Maybe their company gets sued for discrimination. Maybe their biracial nephew gets treated differently than their White nephew. Suddenly they're uncomfortable because their beliefs don't match reality. This is anxious territory.

**Reintegration** is when someone resolves that anxiety by doubling down: "Actually, White people *are* better, and minorities *are* to blame for their problems." It's uncomfortable, but it happens. Think of it as the defensive response when cognitive dissonance gets too painful.

**Pseudo-Independence** looks better on the surface. People here intellectually accept that racism exists and might even call themselves allies. But their "help" often has a savior complex vibe. They're like the person who posts about social justice on Instagram but has never had a meaningful conversation with someone from a different race. They're willing to explain racism to minorities but not to listen and learn.

**Immersion-Emersion** is the real work phase. People here are actively examining what it means to be White, to benefit from White privilege, and to be part of a system that advantages them. They're reading, listening, making mistakes, and learning. It's uncomfortable but productive.

**Autonomy** is the goal: a positive White identity that doesn't require seeing other groups as inferior. People here genuinely value diversity, can discuss race without defensiveness, and have developed real multicultural competence.

Research shows that White therapists with higher racial identity statuses are more effective with clients from minority groups. This isn't optional professional development – it's essential to competent practice.

## Troiden's Model of Homosexual Identity Development: The LGBTQ+ Journey

Troiden's model tracks the journey toward integrating a gay or lesbian identity. The endpoint is when your internal sense of self (self-identity), how you see yourself being perceived (perceived identity), and how you actually present to others (presented identity) all line up.

**Sensitization** happens in childhood. Kids feel different from same-sex peers but usually don't have sexual or romantic language for it yet. Girls might feel they're not feminine enough or are more independent than expected. Boys might prefer reading to sports, feel less aggressive than other boys. At this age, it's just a vague sense of not quite fitting the template.

**Identity Confusion** typically hits in adolescence when same-sex attraction becomes conscious. Cue the anxiety and uncertainty. People try various strategies: denial ("This is just a phase"), avoidance (steering clear of situations that might trigger these feelings), repair (attempting to change through dating the "right" person or even conversion therapy), redefinition (telling yourself it's a temporary thing), or acceptance (beginning to acknowledge the truth).

**Identity Assumption** usually happens in late adolescence or early twenties (19-21 for males, 21-23 for females in Troiden's research). The person accepts their gay or lesbian identity and starts seeking out LGBTQ+ community. They come out to some people – typically LGBTQ+ peers first, then maybe some trusted straight friends and family. It's like dipping your toes in the water of living authentically.

**Identity Commitment** is full integration. People have internalized their identity, accepted it as a way of life, and are comfortable being out to family, friends, and coworkers. Their gay or lesbian identity is just one part of who they are, not a secret or a struggle.

## Worthington's Heterosexual Identity Model: Yes, Straight People Have Sexual Identities Too

Most straight people have never thought about their sexual identity development because it's been treated as default. Worthington's model says that's a problem – everyone has a sexual identity that develops, and understanding that process matters.

This model looks at both **individual sexual identity** (your personal understanding of your sexual needs, values, and preferences) and **social sexual identity** (how you understand yourself in relation to societal norms about sexuality). These interact as people move through five statuses:

**Unexplored Commitment**: You've adopted the sexual identity your family and society handed you without questioning it. Like accepting your parents' political views without examining them yourself.

**Active Exploration**: Purposefully questioning and exploring your sexual needs, values, orientation, and preferences. Maybe trying different types of relationships, questioning societal norms about monogamy, or examining your attractions more carefully.

**Diffusion**: No exploration, no commitment – just confusion about sexual identity and often other aspects of identity too. Like being stuck in a loading screen.

**Deepening and Commitment**: Moving toward clarity and commitment to understanding your sexual needs, values, and preferences.

**Synthesis**: Integrating your sexual identity with your other identities (race, gender, religion, career). It all comes together into a coherent sense of self.

Interestingly, research by Konik and Stewart found that sexual-minority-identified people often described their sexual identity development as requiring more effort than heterosexual-identified people did. However, this extra effort seemed to pay dividends: sexual-minority participants scored higher on overall identity achievement. Perhaps when you're forced to actively construct one aspect of identity, you develop skills that help with other aspects too.

## Common Misconceptions Students Make

**Misconception 1**: "These stages are like stairs – everyone climbs them in order, one at a time."
Reality: People can move back and forth between stages, skip stages, or get stuck in one. Life isn't linear.

**Misconception 2**: "The angry stages (like Resistance and Immersion) are bad and should be skipped."
Reality: These stages are often necessary and healthy. They provide connection to one's culture and protection while processing painful realities.

**Misconception 3**: "All the models are basically the same."
Reality: While there are common themes, each model has unique features. Sellers's model doesn't have stages at all. Worthington's applies to heterosexuals. Know the specific details.

**Misconception 4**: "White people don't have racial identity development."
Reality: Helms's model specifically addresses White identity development. Everyone has a racial identity.

**Misconception 5**: "Once you reach the final stage, you're done."
Reality: Identity development is ongoing. You might cycle through certain aspects again when contexts change (new relationship, new job, new community).

## Memory Strategies for the EPPP

**For R/CID Model**, remember "C-D-R-I-I": Conformity, Dissonance, Resistance, Introspection, Integrative Awareness. Think "CDRII" like "CD-R" (remember those?) with an extra "I" at the end.

**For Cross's Model**, the original stages spell "PEEII": Pre-encounter, Encounter, immersion-Emersion, Internalization, Internalization-commitment. Or remember "PEI-squared" (three stages with "I").

**For Helms's Model**, think of two groups of three: First trio abandons racism (Contact, Disintegration, Reintegration), second trio builds positive identity (Pseudo-Independence, Immersion-Emersion, Autonomy). The IPS strategies get progressively more sophisticated.

**For Troiden's Model**: "SICA" - Sensitization, Identity Confusion, identity Assumption, commitment. Like a fancy coffee order: "I'll have a SICA latte, please."

**Create a comparison table** in your notes with therapy preferences across stages. This is frequently tested. For example, in Conformity, people want majority-group therapists. In Resistance and Immersion, they want own-group therapists. In Integrative Awareness, they want worldview matches.

**Remember the pendulum pattern**: Most racial/cultural models go from valuing the majority culture, to questioning, to strongly valuing own culture, to balanced appreciation of all cultures. Draw this visually if you're a visual learner.

## Key Takeaways

- **The common pattern**: Most racial/cultural identity models move from rejection/unawareness of own culture → awakening → strong embrace of own culture (often with rejection of majority culture) → balanced integration

- **Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's R/CID Model**: Five stages tracking attitudes toward own minority group, other minorities, and majority group. Know therapy preferences at each stage.

- **Cross's Black Identity Model**: Originally five stages (Pre-Encounter through Internalization-Commitment), later revised to three stages with subtypes. The core journey from idealizing White culture to internalizing Black identity remains.

- **Sellers's MMRI**: Not stages but dimensions. Salience (situational), Centrality (stable importance), Regard (private and public), and Ideology (four types: nationalist, oppressed minority, assimilationist, humanist).

- **Helms's White Identity Model**: Six statuses in two phases, each with different information processing strategies. Therapist effectiveness increases with higher statuses. This applies to most psychologists.

- **Troiden's Homosexual Identity Model**: Four stages from childhood Sensitization through Identity Commitment. Integration happens when self-identity, perceived identity, and presented identity align.

- **Worthington's Heterosexual Identity Model**: Five statuses involving both individual and social processes. Highlights that everyone has a sexual identity that develops, not just LGBTQ+ individuals.

- **Clinical application**: Your own identity development status affects your effectiveness as a therapist. Progressive relationships (therapist more advanced than client) work best.

- **For the exam**: Know stage names, characteristics, and therapy preferences. Be able to distinguish between models. Recognize that these are models, not rigid truths, and real people are complex.

Understanding these models isn't just about passing the EPPP – it's about becoming a culturally competent clinician who can meet clients where they are in their identity journey and help them move toward integration and wellness.
