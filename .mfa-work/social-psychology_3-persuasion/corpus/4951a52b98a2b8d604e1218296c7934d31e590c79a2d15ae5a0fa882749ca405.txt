) For timing effects: "Prime Time First" – Primacy occurs when presentations are back-to-back with delayed measurement. "Recent is Fresh" – Recency occurs when there's delay between presentations but immediate measurement. For persuasion susceptibility: Remember the phrase "Medium Self, Low IQ, Youth and Age" to recall that moderate self-esteem, lower intelligence, and both young and older adults are most persuadable. For fear appeals: Think "Fear + Fix" – high fear needs a fix (efficacy message) to work. For loss aversion: Remember "2x" – losses are twice as powerful as gains. For scarcity effects: "Bandwidth Breakdown" – scarcity reduces mental bandwidth, breaking down both cognitive capacity and executive control. Key Takeaways Alpha strategies increase approach forces; omega strategies reduce avoidance forces Communicator credibility depends on expertise and trustworthiness, but the sleeper effect means source memory fades over time Message discrepancy shows an inverted U-shape for low-credible sources but a linear relationship for high-credible sources Primacy effects occur with back-to-back presentations and delayed measurement; recency effects occur with separated presentations and immediate measurement Fear appeals work best when high fear combines with efficacy messages and clear risk descriptions Moderate self-esteem individuals are most persuadable (inverted U); lower intelligence correlates with higher susceptibility (linear); young and older adults are more persuadable than middle-aged (U-shape) Attitude inoculation builds resistance by exposing people to weak counterarguments plus refutations before stronger persuasion attempts Materialism correlates negatively with well-being, especially compulsive buying and negative self-appraisal Scarcity reduces mental bandwidth (cognitive capacity + executive control) and can create self-perpetuating scarcity traps Loss aversion means losses are approximately twice as impactful as equivalent gains, affecting risk-related decisions Understanding persuasion isn't just about passing the E triple P – it's about becoming a more effective clinician who can motivate change, build resistance to harmful influences, and understand the economic factors affecting your clients' decisions and well-being.
