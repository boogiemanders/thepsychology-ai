McGuire's attitude inoculation hypothesis offers a brilliant solution, borrowed from medicine.

The more people prioritize materialistic values, the more likely they are to experience: Compulsive buying behavior (strongest correlation) Risky health behaviors Negative self-appraisal Negative emotions The relationship is particularly strong when materialism is measured with scales that assess multiple dimensions (like how central acquisition is to someone's life and their beliefs about its effects) rather than just desire for money and possessions.

Scarcity: When Not Having Enough Takes Over When people lack something essential, it doesn't just create discomfort – it fundamentally changes how their brain functions. Mullainathan and Shafir's research on scarcity shows that lacking resources causes: Preoccupation with the unfulfilled need (
