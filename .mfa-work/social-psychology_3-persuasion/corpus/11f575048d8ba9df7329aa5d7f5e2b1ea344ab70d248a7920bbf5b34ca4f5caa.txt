Think about job interviews. If a company interviews multiple candidates back-to-back on Monday and makes a decision on Friday, the first few candidates often have an advantage (primacy). But if they interview some candidates on Monday, others on Friday, and decide that same Friday afternoon, those Friday interviews are fresh in mind (recency).
