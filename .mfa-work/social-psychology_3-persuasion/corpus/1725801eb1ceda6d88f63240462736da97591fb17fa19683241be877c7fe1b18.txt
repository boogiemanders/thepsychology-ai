Without the efficacy component, fear just creates anxiety and defensiveness. People shut down rather than change. Recipient Factors: Who's Being Persuaded? Not everyone is equally persuadable. Three factors influence susceptibility. Self-Esteem: The Middle Ground The relationship between self-esteem and persuasion forms another inverted U-shape. People with moderate self-esteem are most easily persuaded. Why? People with low self-esteem might lack confidence in processing new information or fear being wrong. People with high self-esteem might be too confident in their existing views. Those in the middle have enough confidence to consider new information but aren't so rigid that they dismiss it. Intelligence: A Linear Pattern Unlike self-esteem, intelligence shows a linear relationship with persuasion: lower intelligence is associated with higher susceptibility. This makes intuitive sense – people with higher intelligence may be better at identifying weak arguments, considering counterarguments, and resisting faulty logic. Age: Another U-Shape The relationship between age and persuasion is more complex, but research suggests a U-shaped pattern: adolescents/young adults and older adults are more easily persuaded than middle-aged adults.
