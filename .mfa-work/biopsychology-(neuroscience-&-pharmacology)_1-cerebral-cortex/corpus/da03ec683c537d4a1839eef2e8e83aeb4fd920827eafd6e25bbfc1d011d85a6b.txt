The Classic "HEART" Experiment: The word HEART was flashed so that "HE" appeared in the left visual field (processed by right hemisphere) and "ART" appeared in the right visual field (processed by left hemisphere). Patients could only SAY "ART" (left hemisphere controls language) but could POINT to "HE" with their left hand (controlled by right hemisphere). This dramatically demonstrates how the two hemispheres process information independently when the corpus callosum is severed.
