While both hemispheres work together on most tasks, each is dominant for certain functions. For about ninety five% of right-handed people and fifty to seventy% of left-handed people, here's the general pattern: Left Hemisphere (Dominant for most people): Written and spoken language Logical and analytical thinking Positive emotions Controls right side of body Right Hemisphere (Nondominant for most people): Holistic thinking Intuition Spatial relationships Creativity Negative emotions The emotional "music" of speech (prosody) Understanding social context in language (pragmatics) — humor, sarcasm, hyperbole Controls left side of body Exception alert: Smell is different. Odors entering the left nostril go directly to the left hemisphere, and vice versa. Everything else crosses over.
