The P F C has four regions you need to know, and each one has distinct functions and associated disorders: Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (D L P F C) This is your goal-directed behavior center. It handles most executive functions and working memory. That mental workspace where you hold and manipulate information. Damage causes: Impaired goal-directed behavior Concrete thinking (can't think abstractly) Poor judgment and insight Working memory deficits Perseverative responses (getting stuck on the same answer or action) Disinterest and apathy Associated disorders: Major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, schizophrenia Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex (V L P F C) The V L P F C handles decision-making, memory, motor inhibition, and emotion regulation. Damage causes: Impaired decision-making Poor behavioral self-control Poor emotional self-control Associated disorders: Social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (V M P F C) This region is crucial for social cognition and emotion regulation. When you read someone's facial expression or feel empathy, this area is involved. Damage causes: Impaired decision-making Impaired moral judgment Lack of insight Confabulation (making up stories to fill memory gaps without realizing it) Deficits in social cognition (can't read facial emotions, reduced empathy) Blunted emotional responses Associated disorders: Major depression, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, P T S D, schizophrenia Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC) The OFC manages emotion regulation, response inhibition, and social behaviors.
