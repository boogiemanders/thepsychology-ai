Misconception one: "Broca's aphasia means they can't talk, and Wernicke's means they can't understand." Reality: Broca's aphasia means slow, effortful speech with relatively intact comprehension. Wernicke's aphasia means fluent but meaningless speech with impaired comprehension. Misconception two: "Left brain people are logical; right brain people are creative." Reality: While lateralization exists, both hemispheres are involved in most complex tasks. The "left brain/right brain personality" pop psychology oversimplifies actual neuroscience. Misconception three: "Agnosia means sensory loss." Reality: Agnosia occurs with intact sensory function. The sensory information gets through; the problem is recognition or awareness. A person with visual agnosia can see perfectly. They just can't recognize what they're looking at. Misconception four: "Prefrontal cortex damage always causes obvious problems." Reality: Some prefrontal damage can be subtle. A person might seem fine in casual conversation but struggle with complex planning, show poor judgment in real-world situations, or have difficulty regulating emotions under stress.
