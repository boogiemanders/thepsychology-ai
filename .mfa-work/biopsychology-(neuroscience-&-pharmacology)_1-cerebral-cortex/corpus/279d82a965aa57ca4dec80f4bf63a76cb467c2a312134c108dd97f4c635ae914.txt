Bilateral lesions in the occipitotemporal junction (where occipital and temporal lobes meet) can cause prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize familiar faces. In severe cases, people can't recognize their own face in photos, their spouse's face, or even their pet's face. They recognize people by other cues: voice, gait, clothing, context.
