Four lobes, four jobs: Frontal (executive functions, movement, speech production), Temporal (hearing, language comprehension), Parietal (touch, body awareness, skilled movement), Occipital (vision) Broca's vs. Wernicke's: Broca's = can't speak fluently but understands; Wernicke's = speaks fluently but doesn't understand Prefrontal cortex has four regions: Dorsolateral (goal-directed behavior, working memory), Ventrolateral (inhibition, emotion regulation), Ventromedial (social cognition, moral judgment), Orbitofrontal (social appropriateness, impulse control) Apraxia isn't paralysis: It's a planning/execution problem with intact motor function (limb-kinetic, ideomotor, ideational) Gerstmann's syndrome quartet: Right-left confusion, finger agnosia, agraphia, acalculia (left parietal damage) Contralateral neglect: Usually right parietal damage causing neglect of the left side Prosopagnosia: Face blindness from occipitotemporal junction damage Cortical blindness can include blindsight: Responding to visual stimuli without conscious awareness Lateralization is real but complex: Left hemisphere dominant for language in most people; right hemisphere handles emotional prosody and pragmatics Split-brain research revealed lateralization: Each hemisphere has specialized functions that become apparent when they can't communicate Understanding these brain regions and their functions isn't just academic. It's foundational for recognizing neurological contributions to psychological symptoms, making appropriate referrals, and understanding client limitations. When someone struggles with emotion regulation, can't recognize faces, or speaks fluently but makes no sense, you'll know what might be happening neurologically and can respond appropriately.
