The prefrontal cortex (P F C) is where executive functions live. These are the higher-order processes that separate functional adults from people who need significant support: planning, decision-making, working memory, prospective memory (remembering to do things in the future), social judgment, and self-monitoring. The P F C also regulates emotions, motivation, and personality expression.
