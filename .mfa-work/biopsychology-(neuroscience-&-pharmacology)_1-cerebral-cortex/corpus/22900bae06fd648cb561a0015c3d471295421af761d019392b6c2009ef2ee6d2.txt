Cortical blindness occurs when the primary visual cortex is damaged but the eyes and optic nerves work perfectly. The camera works fine, but the screen is broken. Damage to the left visual cortex causes blindness in the right visual field, and vice versa. Here's where it gets weird: some people with cortical blindness exhibit blindsight. They insist they can't see something, but they respond appropriately to it anyway. They'll reach for objects they claim they can't see, or navigate around obstacles they say aren't there. Affective blindsight is even stranger: patients can't consciously see emotional faces shown to them, but they guess correctly (better than chance) whether the face was happy or angry.
