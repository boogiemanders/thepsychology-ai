Much of what we know comes from Sperry's work with split-brain patients. People whose corpus callosums (the bridge connecting the two hemispheres) were surgically severed to treat severe epilepsy. In one classic experiment: When researchers showed a picture of a spoon to the right visual field (processed by the left hemisphere), patients could: Say "spoon" (language is left hemisphere) Pick out a spoon with their right hand by touch (left hemisphere controls right hand) But NOT pick it out with their left hand (left hand is controlled by the right hemisphere, which didn't see the spoon) When they showed the spoon to the left visual field (processed by the right hemisphere), patients: Could NOT say "spoon" (right hemisphere has limited language) Could pick it out with their left hand by touch (right hemisphere controls left hand) But NOT with their right hand
