Global Aphasia: Results from widespread damage to language regions. Most language functions are impaired — both production and comprehension are severely affected. This is the most severe form. Anomic Aphasia: Problems recalling words or names. The person speaks in a roundabout way (circumlocution) — describing things instead of naming them. For example, instead of saying "watch," they might say "the thing you use to tell time." Results from parietal or temporal lobe damage. Transcortical Aphasias: Three types that are similar to Broca's, Wernicke's, and global aphasia, EXCEPT that the ability to repeat words/phrases remains intact. Example: In transcortical motor aphasia, the person can't spontaneously say "I am thirsty" but CAN repeat "I am thirsty" when asked.
