Located in the dominant hemisphere (usually left), Wernicke's area is where language comprehension happens. Damage produces Wernicke's aphasia. Also called receptive or fluent aphasia. This is the opposite pattern from Broca's aphasia. People with Wernicke's aphasia speak fluently, the words flow easily. The problem? Nothing they say makes sense, and they can't understand what others are saying. Key features of Wernicke's aphasia: Fluent but meaningless speech Many word substitutions and errors Impaired comprehension (spoken and written) Impaired repetition Anomia Often unaware of their deficits
