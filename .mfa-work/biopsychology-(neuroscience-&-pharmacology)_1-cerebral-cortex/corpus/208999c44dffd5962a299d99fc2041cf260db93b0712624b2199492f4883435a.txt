Located in the dominant hemisphere (left side for most people), Broca's area is your language production hub. When it's damaged, you get Broca's aphasia. Also called expressive or nonfluent aphasia. Here's what's fascinating: people with Broca's aphasia can understand what you're saying. They know what they want to say. But getting the words out? That's the struggle. Their speech becomes slow and effortful, stripped down to mainly nouns and verbs.
