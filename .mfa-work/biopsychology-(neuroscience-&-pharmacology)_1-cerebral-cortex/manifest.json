It's also where things can go dramatically wrong in ways that will walk into your future office.\n\nUnderstanding the cerebral cortex isn't just about passing an exam. When a client struggles to find the right words, or when someone insists they're fine despite clear signs of stroke, or when a patient shows surprisingly poor judgment despite normal intelligence, you'll need to recognize what's happening neurologically. This knowledge helps you make appropriate referrals, understand limitations, and set realistic treatment goals.\n\nLet's break down this wrinkled outer layer of the brain in a way that actually sticks.",

Wernicke's aphasia means fluent but meaningless speech with impaired comprehension.\n\nMisconception 2: \"Left brain people are logical; right brain people are creative.\"\n\nReality: While lateralization exists, both hemispheres are involved in most complex tasks. The \"left brain/right brain personality\" pop psychology oversimplifies actual neuroscience.\n\nMisconception 3: \"Agnosia means sensory loss.\"\n\nReality: Agnosia occurs with intact sensory function. The sensory information gets through; the problem is recognition or awareness. A person with visual agnosia can see perfectly. They just can't recognize what they're looking at.\n\nMisconception 4: \"Prefrontal cortex damage always causes obvious problems.\"\n\nReality: Some prefrontal damage can be subtle. A person might seem fine in casual conversation but struggle with complex planning, show poor judgment in real-world situations, or have difficulty regulating emotions under stress.",
