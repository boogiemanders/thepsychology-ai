## Why Professional Issues Matter More Than You Think

When most people imagine becoming a psychologist, they picture helping clients through difficult times, conducting therapy sessions, maybe doing research. What they don't always picture? The legal paperwork, the insurance claims, the angry online reviews, or the moment when a subpoena shows up at your office.

But here's the reality: professional issues aren't just administrative headaches. They're the protective framework that keeps you licensed, your clients safe, and your practice viable. Understanding these issues isn't optional—it's what separates psychologists who thrive from those who face disciplinary actions, lawsuits, or worse.

Let's break down what you actually need to know.

## Understanding Malpractice: The Four Ds You Can't Forget

Malpractice claims follow a predictable pattern called the "Four Ds." {{M}}Think of it like a chain reaction—all four links must connect for a malpractice claim to succeed.{{/M}}

| The Four Ds | What It Means | Example |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Duty of Care** | A professional relationship existed where you owed the client a standard of care | You accepted someone as a client, establishing a therapist-client relationship |
| **Dereliction of Duty** | You breached that standard through negligence or misconduct | You failed to assess suicide risk despite clear warning signs |
| **Damages** | The client suffered measurable harm | The client attempted suicide and required hospitalization (measurable economic harm) |
| **Direct Cause** | Your breach directly caused the harm | The suicide attempt was a direct result of your failure to assess and intervene |

Here's the crucial part: if even one D is missing, the malpractice claim typically fails. The client must also prove monetary damages—emotional distress alone usually isn't enough unless it results in quantifiable economic losses.

{{M}}It's like a four-part lock on a safe.{{/M}} The client needs all four numbers to open the case against you. Your job? Make sure you're meeting that duty of care consistently, so those other dominoes never fall.

## What Actually Gets Psychologists in Trouble

The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards keeps track of why psychologists face disciplinary action. Based on data from 1974 to 2023, here are the top ten reasons:

1. **Unprofessional conduct** (the catch-all category)
2. **Sexual misconduct** (any sexual contact with clients)
3. **Negligence** (failing to meet standards of care)
4. **Non-sexual dual relationships** (becoming friends, business partners with clients)
5. **Criminal conviction** (any crime, not just related to practice)
6. **Poor record-keeping** (inadequate or inaccurate documentation)
7. **Ignoring continuing education requirements** (yes, people actually get disciplined for this)
8. **Incompetence** (lacking necessary skills or knowledge)
9. **Improper supervision** (not adequately overseeing trainees)
10. **Violating laws and regulations** (state, federal, or professional rules)

Notice what's conspicuously absent from most psychologists' concerns? Record-keeping and continuing education. Yet they're in the top ten. {{M}}It's like neglecting to change your car's oil because you're focused on the fancy paint job.{{/M}} The boring maintenance matters more than you think.

## When a Subpoena Lands on Your Desk

{{M}}Imagine opening your mail and finding a legal document demanding you testify about a client in court.{{/M}} Your heart rate spikes. What do you do?

The APA provides a clear roadmap:

**Step 1: Verify the subpoena is legitimate**

A valid subpoena must include:
- Court name and jurisdiction
- Case title and docket number
- Plaintiff and defendant names
- Attorney contact information
- Date, time, and location for your appearance
- Specific documents requested
- Official signature or seal

If something's missing or seems off, consult an attorney immediately.

**Step 2: Contact your client**

Before doing anything else, reach out to discuss the implications. Your client has a right to know what's being requested and to make informed decisions about their confidential information.

**Step 3: Get authorization or push back**

If your client authorizes release? You're good to go (but only release what's specifically requested). If they don't authorize? Contact the requesting party to negotiate or withdraw the request.

**Step 4: Seek court guidance if needed**

Still stuck? Ask the court for help—either informally through a letter or formally with a motion to quash the subpoena or request a protective order.

**Step 5: Assert privilege if necessary**

If you're sitting in a deposition or courtroom without client authorization, assert psychotherapist-patient privilege on behalf of your client. Only reveal information with explicit client authorization or a court order.

## Legal Terms That Trip People Up

### Insanity vs. Competency

These are not the same thing, and the exam loves to test this distinction:

**Insanity** refers to the defendant's mental state **at the time of the crime**. It's about whether they understood their actions were legally or morally wrong when they committed the offense. {{M}}Think of it as looking backward through time.{{/M}}

**Competency** refers to the defendant's mental state **right now**. It's about whether they can currently understand the charges against them and cooperate with their attorney. {{M}}This is about the present moment.{{/M}}

Here's a surprising fact: the insanity defense is used in only 1% of criminal cases and succeeds about 25% of the time. So if you're thinking it's constantly abused in the legal system, the data says otherwise.

### Fact Witness vs. Expert Witness

This distinction matters because it determines what you can say in court:

| Fact Witness | Expert Witness |
|--------------|----------------|
| Testifies only to what they directly saw, heard, or observed | Offers professional opinions based on specialized knowledge |
| Cannot give opinions or speculate | Can respond to hypothetical situations |
| Must have firsthand knowledge | Doesn't need personal knowledge of the case |
| Can only testify with client authorization or court order | Qualified by the court as having expertise |

{{M}}A fact witness is like a security camera—they can only report what they recorded.{{/M}} An expert witness is more like a detective who analyzes the footage and explains what it means.

## Psychological Autopsies: Understanding Death After the Fact

When someone dies and the manner of death is unclear, investigators sometimes conduct a psychological autopsy. This involves reconstructing the person's psychological state before death using interviews, records, and other evidence.

There are two main types:

**Equivocal Death Psychological Autopsy (EDPA)**: Used when manner of death is ambiguous—was it suicide, accident, homicide, natural causes, or undetermined?

**Suicide Psychological Autopsy (SPA)**: Used to understand the psychosocial factors that contributed to a confirmed or suspected suicide. These serve forensic purposes (insurance claims, legal cases), research purposes (identifying risk factors), and clinical purposes (helping families understand and grieve).

The biggest criticisms? Lack of standardized procedures, limited reliability and validity research, and potential for incomplete or biased information. Courts accept them more readily in civil cases than criminal cases, but they remain valuable for understanding suicide risk factors.

## Speaking and Writing Without Bias

The APA's guidelines on inclusive language evolve, but core principles remain stable. Here's what matters for the exam:

### Gender and Sex

Don't confuse them. **Sex** refers to biological assignment at birth (usually based on external genitalia). **Gender** refers to the psychological sense of identity and the cultural meanings attached to being masculine, feminine, or other identities.

Key terms:
- **Cisgender**: When gender identity matches sex assigned at birth
- **Transgender**: When gender identity differs from sex assigned at birth
- **Gender non-binary**: Not identifying exclusively as man or woman
- **Gender non-conforming**: Expression or identity doesn't conform to traditional gender norms

When writing about a specific person, use their self-identified pronouns. When gender is irrelevant or the person is hypothetical, use "they/them/their" as singular pronouns. Yes, even in formal writing.

### Sexual Orientation

Avoid outdated terms like "homosexual" (it pathologizes). Instead, use specific, identity-first language: "lesbian women," "gay men," "bisexual adults," "heterosexual people."

Using abbreviations like LGBTQIA+ is fine as long as you define it and it accurately represents the group you're describing.

### Age

Match terms to developmental stages:
- 12 and under: child, girl, boy
- 13-17: adolescent, young person
- 18+: adult, woman, man
- 65+: older adult, older people (NOT "elderly" or "senior citizens")

### Disability

Use person-first language ("person with schizophrenia") or, when preferred by the community, identity-first language ("autistic person"). Never use condescending terms like "AIDS victim" or "confined to a wheelchair."

### Race and Ethnicity

Always capitalize racial and ethnic groups (Blacks, Whites, Latinx). Don't hyphenate when used with third terms (Asian American, not Asian-American). Avoid "minority" without a modifier—use "ethnic minority" or "racial-ethnic minority." Make parallel comparisons: "African Americans and European Americans" or "Blacks and Whites," not mixed.

## Handling Negative Online Reviews

{{M}}You wake up one morning, check your practice's online presence, and there it is: a scathing one-star review claiming you're the worst therapist ever.{{/M}} Your stomach drops. What now?

Here's the hard truth: you probably can't get it removed unless it violates the website's terms of service. And you absolutely cannot respond directly—doing so risks violating confidentiality and HIPAA privacy rules. Even confirming that someone was your client is problematic.

You also can't fight fire with fire by soliciting positive reviews from current clients. That violates ethical guidelines because clients are vulnerable to undue influence from their therapist.

So what can you do? Build a positive online presence proactively. Post patient satisfaction ratings, testimonials from colleagues and supervisors, professional accomplishments. Create enough positive content that a few negative reviews get buried in the noise.

And here's the uncomfortable question: if you're getting multiple negative reviews, maybe that's signal, not noise. Consider consultation to see if legitimate issues in your practice need addressing.

## Telepsychology and Crossing State Lines

Telepsychology—providing services via video, phone, or other technology—exploded during the pandemic. But here's the legal headache: every state has different rules about when you can practice across state lines.

### Without PSYPACT

If jurisdictions aren't part of PSYPACT (we'll get to that), you must determine legal requirements for both your location and your client's location. Some states require full in-state licensure. Others allow limited practice. Some don't permit it at all.

You also need to know local laws for the client's location regarding mandatory reporting, duty to warn, and civil commitment procedures. {{M}}Imagine providing therapy to someone in another state and they become suicidal—you need to know the local emergency resources and legal procedures before that crisis happens.{{/M}}

### With PSYPACT

PSYPACT is an interstate agreement that simplifies cross-state practice. Currently available in over 40 states, it allows licensed psychologists to practice across state lines more easily.

For telepsychology: Get an E.Passport from ASPPB and an Authority to Practice Interjurisdictional Telepsychology (APIT) from the PSYPACT Commission. Then you can provide telepsychology services from your home state to clients in any participating PSYPACT state.

For temporary in-person services: Get an Interjurisdictional Practice Certificate (IPC) and a Temporary Authorization to Practice (TAP). This allows up to 30 days per calendar year of face-to-face practice in other PSYPACT states.

## Clinical Supervision: More Than Just Overseeing Trainees

The ASPPB's supervision guidelines emphasize that supervision is its own distinct competency. Just because you're a great therapist doesn't automatically make you a great supervisor.

### Core Ethical Issues in Supervision

**Competence**: You must be competent both in the services the supervisee provides AND in providing supervision itself. You can't just wing it.

**Confidentiality**: Supervisees need to know the limits of confidentiality regarding their personal disclosures and evaluations. Their clients need to know about the supervisory relationship and that the supervisor has access to their records.

**Multiple relationships**: Avoid them. The power differential makes supervisees vulnerable to exploitation and unable to freely refuse or exit problematic relationships. This especially means no sexual relationships with supervisees.

### Primary vs. Delegated Supervisors

**Primary supervisors** are licensed psychologists with ultimate responsibility. They must:
- Be available 100% of the time supervisees provide services (or arrange backup)
- Inform supervisees of emergency procedures
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Keep detailed supervision records for 7 years or until licensure (whichever is longer)

**Delegated supervisors** are licensed health professionals to whom primary supervisors can delegate specific responsibilities when appropriate—for example, when the service requires expertise beyond the primary supervisor's area or when continuity of supervision is needed.

### Telepsychology Supervision Rules

Telepsychology supervision can account for no more than 50% of total supervision at any site. Interjurisdictional telepsychology supervision (supervisor and supervisee in different jurisdictions) is generally prohibited except in emergencies. Supervisors must verify supervisee identity at each contact and inform them about security and privacy limitations.

### Models of Supervision

Three main categories exist:

**Psychotherapy-based models** apply therapeutic orientations to supervision. For example, cognitive-behavioral supervision (CBS) mirrors CBT therapy—it's structured, goal-directed, time-limited, and uses techniques like Socratic questioning and behavioral rehearsal. {{M}}Each session follows a predictable format: check-in, set the agenda, bridge from last time, review cases, assign homework, summarize, get feedback.{{/M}}

**Developmental models** assume supervisees progress through stages requiring different supervisory approaches. The Integrated Developmental Model identifies three levels:

- **Level 1**: Self-focused, anxious, highly dependent. Needs structure, support, and skill-building.
- **Level 2**: Better client focus, fluctuating confidence, alternates between dependence and independence. Needs less structure, shared responsibility, constructive feedback.
- **Level 3**: Balanced self-other awareness, consistent motivation, confident. Needs collegial relationship and fostering of independence.

**Process-based models** focus on supervisory roles and tasks. Bernard's discrimination model identifies three focus areas (intervention skills, conceptualization skills, personalization skills) and three supervisor roles (educator, counselor, consultant). {{M}}The supervisor shifts between these nine possible combinations based on what the supervisee needs at that moment—like selecting the right tool from a toolbox.{{/M}}

### The Working Alliance in Supervision

Just as the therapeutic alliance predicts therapy outcomes, the supervisory working alliance predicts supervision success. It consists of three components:

1. Mutually agreed-upon goals
2. Mutually agreed-upon tasks
3. Strength of the emotional bond

Research shows positive correlations between supervisees' perceptions of the working alliance and their self-efficacy, willingness to self-disclose in supervision, satisfaction, and quality of relationships with their own clients. Good supervision creates ripple effects that benefit clients.

## Accreditation: Why It Matters

Accreditation is formal evaluation of educational programs against defined standards. Three types exist:

- **National accreditation**: Applies to entire institutions
- **Regional accreditation**: Also applies to entire institutions
- **Specialized/program accreditation**: Applies to specific departments, programs, or freestanding institutions

The APA Commission on Accreditation (APA-CoA) is the primary specialized accreditation agency for psychology in the U.S. It accredits doctoral programs in practice areas (clinical, counseling, school psychology), doctoral internships, and postdoctoral residencies.

Why does this matter? Accreditation assures the public that programs meet professional standards supporting ethical, skillful service delivery. It protects students, benefits the public, and improves quality. For you? Graduating from an APA-accredited program often makes licensure and insurance credentialing easier.

## Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS)

JARS provides guidelines for reporting quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research. Modeled after medical reporting standards (like CONSORT for randomized trials), JARS ensures research articles include essential information.

For example, a meta-analysis abstract should include:
- Study objectives
- Eligibility criteria for included studies
- Synthesis methods
- Primary outcomes and effect sizes with confidence intervals
- Conclusions

Why does this matter for the exam? Understanding reporting standards helps you evaluate research quality and understand what's missing when studies lack transparency.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception 1**: "Insanity and competency are basically the same thing."
- Reality: Insanity looks backward (mental state during the crime); competency looks at the present (ability to participate in legal proceedings now).

**Misconception 2**: "If I get a subpoena, I have to immediately comply."
- Reality: You should verify validity, contact the client, and potentially negotiate or challenge it.

**Misconception 3**: "I can respond to negative online reviews if I keep it vague and don't name the client."
- Reality: Any response risks ethical violations and HIPAA issues. Build positive presence instead.

**Misconception 4**: "PSYPACT means I can practice anywhere without restrictions."
- Reality: PSYPACT only works between participating states and has specific requirements for telepsychology vs. temporary in-person services.

**Misconception 5**: "Supervision is just about teaching therapy skills."
- Reality: Supervision is a distinct competency involving ethics, gate-keeping, remediation, and professional development beyond clinical skills.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For the Four Ds**: Create a mnemonic story: "**D**octor **D**enise **D**ropped **D**ishes" (Duty, Dereliction, Damages, Direct cause)

**For subpoena response**: Remember "VCANS" - Verify, Contact client, Authorize or negotiate, Need court guidance?, Shield with privilege

**For insanity vs. competency**: TIME matters—insanity is about THEN (past), competency is about NOW (present)

**For supervision levels**: Level 1 = "Me, me, me" (self-focused), Level 2 = "Maybe, maybe not" (fluctuating), Level 3 = "Mutual respect" (collegial)

**For fact vs. expert witness**: Fact = Footage only; Expert = Explanation allowed

## Key Takeaways

- **Malpractice requires all Four Ds**: duty, dereliction, damages, direct cause—missing even one breaks the chain
- **Most disciplinary actions involve**: unprofessional conduct, sexual misconduct, negligence, dual relationships, or surprisingly mundane issues like poor record-keeping
- **Responding to subpoenas**: verify legitimacy, contact client, get authorization, negotiate if needed, assert privilege without authorization
- **Insanity ≠ competency**: insanity concerns mental state during the crime; competency concerns current ability to participate in proceedings
- **Online reviews**: can't respond directly; build positive presence proactively
- **Telepsychology across states**: know the rules for both locations; PSYPACT simplifies this for participating states
- **Inclusive language**: use person-first or identity-first language based on community preference; avoid outdated terms
- **Supervision is a distinct competency**: requires specific skills beyond clinical expertise
- **Supervisory working alliance**: predicts supervision and ultimately client outcomes
- **Accreditation protects everyone**: students, clients, and the profession

Professional issues aren't sexy, but they're the scaffolding holding up your entire career. Master them, and you'll practice with confidence. Ignore them, and you're one mistake away from serious consequences.
