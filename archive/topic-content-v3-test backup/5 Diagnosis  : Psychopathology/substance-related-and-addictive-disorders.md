## Why Substance-Related Disorders Matter for Your Practice

When you start working as a psychologist, you'll quickly realize that substance use shows up everywhere. It's not just in addiction treatment centers. Your client dealing with depression might also be drinking heavily. The couple in your office for marriage counseling might be arguing because one person can't stop smoking weed. The executive you're seeing for anxiety might be taking their prescription sedatives in ways that weren't intended.

Understanding substance-related disorders isn't just about identifying addiction. It's about recognizing how substances interact with almost every other mental health issue you'll encounter. This knowledge will help you make accurate diagnoses, choose appropriate treatments, and potentially save lives.

## The Big Picture: Two Main Categories

The DSM-5-TR organizes substance problems into two broad categories. Think of them as short-term crises versus long-term patterns.

**Substance-Induced Disorders** are the immediate effects. These are the episodes that happen when someone uses too much of a substance or stops using it suddenly. We're talking about intoxication, withdrawal, and other mental disorders directly caused by substances (like substance-induced depression or anxiety).

**Substance-Use Disorders** are the ongoing patterns. This is when someone keeps using a substance even though it's clearly causing problems in their life. The pattern continues for at least 12 months and involves at least two symptoms from a list of criteria.

Here's what makes this practical: You need to know both. When someone comes to your office appearing depressed, you need to determine if they have depression that exists independently, or if their symptoms are actually caused by alcohol withdrawal. The treatment paths are completely different.

## Understanding Substance-Use Disorders

The core feature of a substance-use disorder is continued use despite problems. {{M}}It's like continuing to use a dating app that consistently matches you with incompatible people, costs you money, makes your friends worried, and leaves you feeling worse—but you keep swiping anyway.{{/M}} The person knows it's causing issues, but they can't stop.

The DSM-5-TR covers ten substance classes: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives/hypnotics/anxiolytics, stimulants, tobacco, and a catch-all "other" category. You can diagnose a substance-use disorder for any of these except caffeine (yes, caffeine has its own problems, but not a full use disorder).

Severity matters. The diagnosis includes specifiers that tell you how serious things are, based on symptom count. You'll also specify if the person is in early remission, sustained remission, on maintenance therapy, or in a controlled environment. These details aren't just paperwork—they guide treatment planning.

## The Substance-Induced Disorders You Need to Know

Let me walk you through the most important substance-induced disorders. These are high-yield for the EPPP, and you'll definitely see them in practice.

### Alcohol Intoxication and Withdrawal

**Alcohol Intoxication** is what most people call being drunk, but the clinical diagnosis requires specific criteria. You need problematic behavioral or psychological changes (inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood swings, poor judgment) plus at least one physical sign: slurred speech, poor coordination, unsteady walking, nystagmus (involuntary eye movements), problems with attention or memory, or stupor/coma.

**Alcohol Withdrawal** is more serious than most people realize. It develops within hours to a few days after someone stops or reduces heavy, prolonged drinking. You need at least two of these eight symptoms: autonomic hyperactivity (sweating, rapid heart rate), hand tremor, insomnia, nausea or vomiting, hallucinations or illusions, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, or generalized seizures.

That last one—seizures—is why alcohol withdrawal can be life-threatening. Never underestimate it. {{M}}If someone tells you they're a heavy drinker and they're planning to quit cold turkey, it's like hearing someone say they're going to perform surgery on themselves—you need to intervene immediately and recommend medical supervision.{{/M}}

### Alcohol-Induced Major Neurocognitive Disorder

Long-term heavy drinking can cause permanent brain damage. This disorder requires evidence of significant cognitive decline that interferes with independence in daily activities.

There are two types. The non-amnestic-confabulatory type involves cognitive problems but not primarily memory issues. The amnestic-confabulatory type is what we call **Korsakoff syndrome**. This one's caused by thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1) and involves severe memory problems—both anterograde (can't form new memories) and retrograde (can't recall old memories). People with Korsakoff syndrome often confabulate, meaning they fill in memory gaps with fabricated information. They're not lying—their brain is trying to make sense of missing information.

### Opioid Intoxication and Withdrawal

Opioids include natural substances (opium, heroin, morphine, codeine) and synthetic/semi-synthetic drugs (methadone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl). Given the ongoing opioid crisis, you'll likely encounter these issues regularly.

**Opioid Intoxication** involves problematic behavioral or psychological changes (initial euphoria followed by apathy or dysphoria, impaired judgment) plus pupillary constriction (pinpoint pupils—this is a key sign) and at least one of: drowsiness or coma, slurred speech, or impaired attention/memory. Sometimes people experience perceptual disturbances—hallucinations with intact reality testing or illusions without delirium.

**Opioid Withdrawal** feels terrible but, unlike alcohol withdrawal, it's not typically life-threatening. You need at least three of nine symptoms after stopping heavy use: dysphoric mood, nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, diarrhea, yawning, fever, insomnia. {{M}}People often describe it as feeling like the worst flu of their life, multiplied by ten.{{/M}}

### Stimulant Intoxication and Withdrawal

Stimulants include amphetamines, methamphetamines, and cocaine. These drugs speed up your system.

**Stimulant Intoxication** involves maladaptive changes (euphoria or emotional blunting, hypervigilance, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety or anger, impaired judgment) plus at least two of nine symptoms: heart rate changes, pupil dilation, blood pressure changes, sweating or chills, nausea or vomiting, weight loss, psychomotor agitation or slowing, respiratory depression or heart arrhythmia, seizures or coma.

**Stimulant Withdrawal** is the crash after the high. You need dysphoric mood plus at least two of five changes that develop within hours to days after stopping: fatigue, vivid unpleasant dreams, insomnia or excessive sleeping, increased appetite, or psychomotor changes.

### Tobacco Withdrawal

Don't underestimate nicotine addiction. **Tobacco Withdrawal** requires at least four of seven symptoms developing within 24 hours of stopping or reducing tobacco use: irritability, anger or anxiety, impaired concentration, increased appetite, restlessness, depressed mood, or insomnia.

Here's what's clinically important: Withdrawal symptoms typically peak 48-72 hours after quitting and gradually decrease over several weeks. But cravings last much longer than withdrawal symptoms and can cause relapse months or even years later.

### Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder

This is the formal term for "flashbacks." After using LSD or other hallucinogens, some people re-experience perceptual symptoms days, weeks, months, or even years later. Visual disturbances are most common—flashes of color, halos around objects, trails following moving objects.

The key diagnostic feature: Reality testing remains intact. The person knows these symptoms are from previous drug use, not from current intoxication. The episodes cause significant distress or impairment, and they're not due to another medical or mental condition.

## A Quick Reference Table for Intoxication and Withdrawal

| Substance | Key Intoxication Signs | Key Withdrawal Signs | Life-Threatening? |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Alcohol | Slurred speech, poor coordination, nystagmus | Tremor, sweating, anxiety, seizures | Withdrawal can be |
| Opioids | Pinpoint pupils, drowsiness, slurred speech | Muscle aches, diarrhea, dysphoria, yawning | Rarely |
| Stimulants | Pupil dilation, heart rate changes, hypervigilance | Fatigue, increased appetite, dysphoria | Rarely |
| Tobacco | N/A (intoxication not diagnosed) | Irritability, concentration problems, increased appetite | No |

## Evidence-Based Treatments That Actually Work

Treatment isn't one-size-fits-all. It varies by substance type, severity, co-occurring disorders, and client preferences. But research consistently shows that combined approaches—therapy plus medication when appropriate—work best.

### Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA)

CRA is based on operant conditioning principles. The core idea: Make healthy, drug-free living more rewarding than substance use. {{M}}Think of it as competing with the substance by making the rest of life more attractive—like when you finally quit a toxic relationship because you've built such a great friend group and career that the drama isn't worth it anymore.{{/M}}

**Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT)** is a related approach for when the person with the substance problem refuses treatment. Instead of working with the person directly, a therapist works with a concerned family member or friend (called a "concerned significant other" or CSO). The goals are helping the CSO influence the person to enter treatment, teaching the CSO ways to reduce substance use, and improving the CSO's quality of life regardless of whether the person seeks help.

### Voucher-Based Reinforcement Therapy (VBRT)

This is contingency management in action. Clients receive vouchers they can exchange for goods and services when they meet treatment goals—typically when urine drug screens come back negative.

Research shows VBRT effectively promotes abstinence for cocaine, opiates, marijuana, and tobacco. But there's a catch: Effects often fade when vouchers stop. That's why experts recommend combining it with cognitive-behavioral therapy. VBRT gets people to initial abstinence, while CBT provides coping skills for maintaining abstinence long-term.

### Personalized Normative Feedback (PNF)

Here's the assumption behind PNF: People overestimate how much others use substances, and this misperception influences their own use. Correct the misperception, and behavior should change.

{{M}}Imagine you're convinced everyone at your workplace regularly works until 9 PM, so you do too. Then you see actual data showing most people leave by 5:30 PM. Suddenly, your behavior doesn't seem so normal, and you might adjust.{{/M}}

PNF typically involves showing clients three pieces of information: their own usage, their perception of typical peer usage, and actual average peer usage. It was originally developed for heavy-drinking college students but now applies to various substances, gambling, eating disorders, and other problematic behaviors.

It works both as a stand-alone intervention and combined with motivational interviewing.

### Text Message Interventions

Text messages serve four major functions in mental health treatment: appointment and medication reminders, health information, support, and self-monitoring tools.

For smoking cessation specifically, research shows that text messaging alone produces better quit rates than minimal support (like general health advice). Text messaging alone produces similar quit rates to other single interventions like brief counseling. And text messaging plus other interventions produces better quit rates than those other interventions alone.

This matters for your practice because it's accessible, low-cost, and easy to implement alongside whatever else you're doing.

### Relapse Prevention Therapy (RPT)

Marlatt and Gordon developed this cognitive-behavioral approach based on viewing addiction as a learned habit pattern. Lapses typically happen in high-risk situations—negative emotions, interpersonal conflict, social pressure.

Here's the crucial insight: A lapse is most likely to become a full relapse when someone has poor coping skills, low self-efficacy, high expectations about positive substance effects, and experiences an "abstinence violation effect." That's when someone has one drink after months of sobriety and thinks, "I've completely failed. I'm a terrible person. I might as well keep drinking."

RPT teaches skills for recognizing and handling high-risk situations. Techniques include coping skills training, enhancing self-efficacy, challenging substance-related myths, cognitive restructuring to view lapses as learning experiences rather than failures, and modifying lifestyle factors that increase risk.

### Project MATCH: What We Learned

Project MATCH was a major study comparing three treatments for alcohol use: cognitive behavioral coping skills therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, and twelve-step facilitation. It also tested whether matching certain client characteristics to specific treatments improved outcomes.

Results: All three treatments significantly reduced drinking at one-year and three-year follow-ups, with twelve-step facilitation having a slight edge. There was some support for matching—for instance, clients with social networks supportive of drinking benefited most from twelve-step facilitation, while clients high in anger benefited most from motivational enhancement therapy.

The takeaway for practice: These evidence-based approaches generally work well, but client characteristics and preferences matter. Pay attention to the person in front of you, not just the diagnosis.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception 1: "Withdrawal is always dangerous."**
Actually, only alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal can be life-threatening due to seizure risk. Opioid withdrawal feels awful but is rarely medically dangerous. Stimulant and tobacco withdrawal are uncomfortable but not life-threatening.

**Misconception 2: "You need to hit rock bottom before treatment works."**
This myth causes unnecessary suffering. Treatment can be effective at any stage. Early intervention often produces better outcomes with less damage to relationships, careers, and health.

**Misconception 3: "Abstinence is the only valid goal."**
While abstinence is appropriate for many people and many substances, harm reduction approaches can be valuable, especially for engaging people not ready for complete abstinence. The evidence supports meeting clients where they are.

**Misconception 4: "Relapse means treatment failed."**
Relapse is common with substance use disorders, just as symptom recurrence is common with other chronic conditions like diabetes or asthma. It means the treatment plan needs adjustment, not that treatment doesn't work.

**Misconception 5: "Substance-induced disorders aren't 'real' mental disorders."**
Substance-induced depression, anxiety, psychosis, and neurocognitive disorders are genuine clinical conditions requiring appropriate treatment. They're not just "being high" or "coming down."

## Memory Aids for the EPPP

**For alcohol withdrawal symptoms**, remember the phrase "Hands shake, heart races, sleepless nights" to recall tremor, autonomic hyperactivity, and insomnia—three of the most common symptoms.

**For opioid intoxication**, think of the pupils: Opioids make pupils tiny (pinpoint). This is the opposite of stimulants, which dilate pupils.

**For substance-use disorder severity**, remember you need at least two symptoms in 12 months for any diagnosis. More symptoms = more severe.

**For distinguishing intoxication from withdrawal**, think about timing and direction:
- Intoxication = during or shortly after use
- Withdrawal = after cessation or reduction of heavy, prolonged use
- Intoxication effects often oppose withdrawal effects (stimulants cause euphoria during intoxication, dysphoria during withdrawal)

**For Korsakoff syndrome**, remember "Korsakoff = Can't Keep (K-K) memories" for the characteristic amnesia, plus confabulation.

**For treatment approaches**, remember that combination approaches consistently outperform single interventions. If you see a question asking about optimal treatment, look for combined therapy and medication options.
