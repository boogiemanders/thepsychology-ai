## Why This Topic Matters for Your Practice

When you start working as a psychologist, you'll quickly realize that many of your clients aren't struggling with mental disorders—they're struggling with work. They'll talk about impossible workloads, unfair bosses, burnout, and the constant juggle between career demands and family life. Understanding job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and workplace stress isn't just academic knowledge—it's essential for helping real people navigate one of the most significant parts of their lives.

This material also appears frequently on the EPPP because it bridges multiple domains: social psychology, cognitive-affective processes, and organizational behavior. Let's break it down into concepts you can actually use and remember.

## Job Satisfaction: Why Some People Love Mondays and Others Dread Them

### What Determines Job Satisfaction?

You might assume that job satisfaction is all about external factors—salary, benefits, office environment. But research reveals something surprising: some people tend to be satisfied (or dissatisfied) across different jobs throughout their careers. This stability suggests that internal factors play a major role.

**Three Key Internal Factors:**

**Self-esteem** significantly predicts both job satisfaction and life satisfaction. People who feel good about themselves generally feel better about their work. This makes intuitive sense—{{M}}it's like having a pair of glasses that tint everything you see{{/M}}. If you view yourself positively, you're more likely to interpret workplace experiences favorably.

**Affective disposition** refers to your general tendency to respond to situations favorably or unfavorably. Some people have a naturally positive outlook, while others tend toward negativity across different contexts. This isn't about being realistic or pessimistic—it's about baseline emotional responses.

**Genetic predisposition** might sound far-fetched, but there's actual evidence for it. A famous study of male identical twins who were separated at birth found they had similar levels of job satisfaction as adults, despite working in completely different fields and environments. Researchers estimated that about 30% of the variation in job satisfaction can be attributed to genetic factors. The other 70%? That's where environment, choice, and circumstance come in.

### Organizational Justice: The Fairness Factor

While internal factors matter, external workplace conditions are crucial. One of the most powerful predictors of job satisfaction is organizational justice—how fair people perceive their workplace to be. There are three types:

| Type of Justice | What It Means | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Distributive Justice** | Fairness of outcomes and resources | Are salaries, promotions, and bonuses distributed fairly? |
| **Procedural Justice** | Fairness of the process used to make decisions | Are performance reviews conducted consistently? Do employees have a voice? |
| **Interactional Justice** | Fairness in how information is communicated | Does your boss explain decisions respectfully and provide adequate information? |

Interactional justice breaks down further into interpersonal (how you're treated during interactions) and informational (how thoroughly decisions are explained to you).

All three types relate positively to job satisfaction, though researchers debate which matters most. What's clear is that feeling treated unfairly—whether in outcomes, processes, or communication—significantly damages job satisfaction.

### What Job Satisfaction Actually Predicts

This is crucial for the EPPP: the relationships between job satisfaction and various outcomes are real but modest. Don't expect huge correlation coefficients.

**Job satisfaction relates to:**

- **Longevity and health**: Satisfied employees live longer and enjoy better physical and psychological health (the link with psychological health is stronger)
- **Job performance**: The correlation ranges from .17 to .30 depending on the study—statistically significant but not enormous
- **Absenteeism and turnover**: Satisfied employees are less likely to miss work or quit, but again, the relationships are moderate

The relationship between satisfaction and performance is particularly interesting because the direction of causality remains debated. Does satisfaction lead to better performance, or does better performance lead to satisfaction? Research suggests that when pay is closely tied to performance, performance might actually drive satisfaction rather than the other way around. {{M}}Think about it like exercising—you might not love working out initially, but when you see results, you start enjoying it more{{/M}}.

## Organizational Commitment: Why People Stay (or Leave)

Organizational commitment differs from job satisfaction. You might not love your daily tasks but still feel committed to your organization—or vice versa. There are three distinct types:

**Affective commitment** is emotional attachment. {{M}}It's like staying in a relationship because you genuinely love the person{{/M}}—you want to be there. Employees with high affective commitment identify with organizational values and goals.

**Continuance commitment** is staying because leaving would be costly. {{M}}It's like remaining in a relationship because you share a lease and can't afford to move out{{/M}}. Financial considerations, lack of alternative jobs, or loss of benefits keep people in place.

**Normative commitment** involves feeling obligated to stay. {{M}}It's like staying because you feel loyal or because the organization invested heavily in training you{{/M}}. There's a sense of duty or moral obligation.

Of these three, **affective commitment consistently shows the strongest relationships with positive job outcomes**. People who are emotionally attached to their organizations perform better, are more satisfied, and are less likely to leave. For the EPPP, remember that affective commitment is the "golden" type—it's what organizations should cultivate.

The correlation coefficients between organizational commitment and job outcomes are similar to those for job satisfaction—low to moderate. The relationship is somewhat stronger for satisfaction than for performance or turnover.

## Stress: When Work Pushes You Beyond Your Limits

Stress occurs when any force pushes a psychological or physical function beyond its stable range, creating strain within the person. Understanding stress is essential because it's both a common client complaint and a personal challenge you'll face in practice.

### The General Adaptation Syndrome: Your Body's Response

Hans Selye proposed that our bodies respond to all stressors with the same three-stage sequence, which he called the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS):

**Stage 1: Alarm Reaction**

{{M}}Imagine your body's alarm system suddenly blaring{{/M}}. The hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which triggers two pathways:

- The sympathetic nervous system activates, and the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine and norepinephrine
- The pituitary gland releases ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol

These hormones increase heart rate, respiration, and glucose levels—preparing you for fight-or-flight. This response is adaptive for acute threats.

**Stage 2: Resistance**

If the stressor continues, you enter the resistance stage. Some physiological functions normalize, but cortisol remains elevated to maintain high energy levels and help you cope. {{M}}It's like your body shifting from panic mode to sustained high alert{{/M}}—you're managing, but at a cost.

**Stage 3: Exhaustion**

When stress persists too long without resolution, your pituitary and adrenal glands can't maintain elevated hormone levels anymore. Physiological processes break down. This is when serious health consequences emerge.

### The Hidden Costs of Chronic Stress

Prolonged stress and chronically elevated cortisol have serious consequences:

- **Immune suppression**: You become more susceptible to infections and illnesses
- **Cardiovascular problems**: Elevated blood pressure increases heart attack risk
- **Digestive issues**: Headaches, indigestion, and stomach problems
- **Sleep disruption**: Insomnia becomes common
- **Cognitive impairment**: Elevated cortisol can damage hippocampal cells, impairing your ability to form new long-term memories

This last point is particularly relevant for psychologists. If your clients are under chronic stress, their memory formation may be literally compromised—something to consider when teaching coping strategies or processing trauma.

## Major Sources of Workplace Stress

### Lack of Control

One of the most consistent findings in stress research is that lacking control over your work conditions increases stress and its negative effects. Meta-analyses show that low perceived control relates to:

- Job dissatisfaction
- Reduced performance
- Emotional distress
- Physical health problems

The research on machine-paced versus self-paced work is particularly striking—workers on assembly lines with no control over pace show higher cortisol levels than those who can control their work speed. {{M}}It's the difference between being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic versus choosing a scenic route at your own pace{{/M}}—even if both trips take the same time, the experience feels entirely different.

### Work-Family Conflict

Work-family conflict happens when your work role and personal life role clash. Maybe you're missing your child's school event because of a work deadline, or you're distracted during therapy sessions because of family stress. This conflict is a major stressor linked to:

- Lower job satisfaction
- Lower life satisfaction
- Increased psychological symptoms

Interestingly, research across multiple countries found that men and women report similar overall levels of work-family conflict. However, small differences emerge in specific contexts: in dual-earner couples, men report slightly more work-to-family interference, while women report slightly more family-to-work interference. These differences are small but consistent.

### Downsizing: The Stress Everyone Feels

Downsizing—the planned elimination of jobs to cut costs—creates obvious stress for those who lose jobs. Less obvious but equally important is the impact on survivors.

**Survivor syndrome** includes:
- Reduced job satisfaction and organizational commitment
- Loss of control feelings
- Anxiety, depression, and insomnia
- Somatic symptoms
- Guilt about surviving when colleagues didn't

This syndrome often stems from the organization violating the **psychological contract**—the unspoken, implied exchange relationship between employee and employer. {{M}}When you start a job, there's an invisible handshake that says, "Work hard and you'll have security"{{/M}}. Downsizing shatters that trust, even for those who keep their jobs.

To minimize damage, organizations should use fair procedures for determining layoffs and communicate these procedures clearly to all employees.

## Job Burnout: The End Stage of Chronic Work Stress

Burnout is a specific syndrome resulting from chronic work stress. Christina Maslach and her colleagues identified three core characteristics:

**The Three Dimensions of Burnout:**

| Dimension | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Exhaustion** | Deep physical and emotional depletion—you're running on empty |
| **Depersonalization/Cynicism** | Treating clients or coworkers as objects rather than people; developing a negative, detached attitude |
| **Reduced Sense of Efficacy** | Feeling incompetent and doubting your ability to accomplish anything meaningful |

An early warning sign of burnout is putting in more time and effort without seeing increased productivity—{{M}}like spinning your wheels in sand, working harder but going nowhere{{/M}}. This is often accompanied by irritability, negativity, social withdrawal, and physical symptoms like headaches or digestive problems.

### What Increases Burnout Risk?

Maslach and colleagues identified six areas where mismatches between person and work environment increase burnout risk:

1. **Workload**: Too much work with too few resources
2. **Control**: Lack of autonomy or input into decisions
3. **Reward**: Insufficient recognition, financial compensation, or social rewards
4. **Community**: Lack of positive connections with coworkers; workplace conflict
5. **Fairness**: Perceived inequity or injustice
6. **Values**: Conflict between personal values and organizational demands

For future psychologists, burnout is particularly relevant. The helping professions have high rates of burnout due to emotional demands, vicarious trauma, and often inadequate organizational support.

## What Makes Some People More Stress-Resistant?

While stress is universal, people vary dramatically in how they respond to it. Three characteristics increase resilience:

### Hardiness

Kobasa's research on hardiness identified three interconnected characteristics that buffer against stress:

- **Control**: Hardy people believe they can influence events in their lives
- **Commitment**: They're deeply invested in their activities, relationships, and work
- **Challenge**: They view new experiences as opportunities for growth rather than threats

{{M}}Think of hardy individuals as having psychological shock absorbers{{/M}}—they experience the same bumps but handle them with less damage. Research confirms that hardiness protects both physical and mental health.

### Organization-Based Self-Esteem (OBSE)

OBSE refers to how valuable you perceive yourself to be as an organization member. High OBSE is linked to:

- Greater job satisfaction
- Stronger organizational commitment
- Better stress management (active rather than passive coping)

People with low OBSE are more vulnerable to stress and tend to cope passively—enduring rather than addressing problems.

### Type A Behavior Pattern: The Risk Factor

Unlike hardiness and OBSE, Type A behavior increases vulnerability to stress's negative effects. The pattern includes:

- Chronic sense of time urgency
- Excessive competitiveness
- Hostility

Initially, researchers thought the entire pattern predicted heart disease. More recent evidence suggests that **hostility** is the component most strongly linked to cardiovascular problems. {{M}}It's not the hurrying or the ambition that hurts you—it's the anger and antagonism{{/M}}.

For the EPPP, remember that Type A is the outlier here—it's associated with worse outcomes, while hardiness and OBSE are protective.

## Common Misconceptions Students Hold

**Misconception 1**: "Job satisfaction and performance have a strong correlation."
**Reality**: The relationship is real but modest (.17 to .30), and causality may run from performance to satisfaction rather than the reverse.

**Misconception 2**: "Job satisfaction is mostly about pay and working conditions."
**Reality**: About 30% of job satisfaction variability comes from genetic factors. Internal characteristics matter enormously.

**Misconception 3**: "All three types of organizational commitment are equally beneficial."
**Reality**: Affective commitment consistently shows the strongest positive relationships with job outcomes.

**Misconception 4**: "Downsizing only affects those who lose their jobs."
**Reality**: Survivors often experience significant negative effects through survivor syndrome.

**Misconception 5**: "The entire Type A behavior pattern predicts heart disease."
**Reality**: Hostility appears to be the component most associated with cardiovascular risk.

## Memory Strategies for the EPPP

**For the three types of organizational justice**, remember **DPI** (like dots per inch on a screen):
- **D**istributive: Distribution of outcomes
- **P**rocedural: Process used
- **I**nteractional: Interaction and communication

**For the three types of organizational commitment**, think **ACN** (like the television network):
- **A**ffective: Attachment (emotion)
- **C**ontinuance: Cost of leaving (calculation)
- **N**ormative: Necessity/obligation (duty)

**For General Adaptation Syndrome stages**, remember **ARE**:
- **A**larm: Initial response
- **R**esistance: Ongoing coping
- **E**xhaustion: Breakdown

**For the three burnout dimensions**, remember **EDE**:
- **E**xhaustion
- **D**epersonalization
- **E**fficacy (reduced)

**For hardiness components**, remember the **three C's**:
- **C**ontrol
- **C**ommitment
- **C**hallenge

## Key Takeaways

- Job satisfaction has stability across time and jobs, with approximately 30% attributable to genetic factors
- Three types of organizational justice (distributive, procedural, interactional) all positively relate to job satisfaction
- Correlations between job satisfaction and performance are real but modest (.17-.30); causality may run from performance to satisfaction
- Affective commitment (emotional attachment) shows the strongest relationships with positive job outcomes among the three types of organizational commitment
- The General Adaptation Syndrome describes three stages: alarm reaction, resistance, and exhaustion
- Chronic stress and elevated cortisol damage the immune system, cardiovascular system, and hippocampus (impairing memory formation)
- Major workplace stressors include lack of control, work-family conflict, and downsizing (which affects survivors too)
- Job burnout has three core characteristics: exhaustion, depersonalization/cynicism, and reduced efficacy
- Hardiness (control, commitment, challenge) and organization-based self-esteem increase stress resistance
- Type A behavior pattern, particularly the hostility component, increases vulnerability to stress-related health problems, especially cardiovascular disease
- The psychological contract (implied exchange relationship) matters—its violation through downsizing causes survivor syndrome even in those who keep their jobs

Understanding these concepts prepares you not only for EPPP questions but also for the reality of practice, where workplace issues will be a constant theme in your clients' lives—and potentially in your own career management.
