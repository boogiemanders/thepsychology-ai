    },
    "correct_answer": "A",

    },
    "correct_answer": "A",

    "correct_answer": "A",
    "kn_id": "KN15",
    "explanation": "In certain conditions, young children's testimony is more accurate because they have less knowledge. Greater knowledge in older individuals increases likelihood of generating spontaneous false memories from suggestive information."
