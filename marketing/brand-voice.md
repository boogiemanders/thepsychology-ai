# thePsychology.ai Voice Profile

## Voice Summary

Sounds like the friend who already passed the EPPP and is telling you exactly what worked — no sugarcoating, no upselling, no filler. Clinical credibility wrapped in startup directness. Makes you feel like someone who actually understands your exhaustion just handed you a shortcut. Empathetic but efficient. The voice of a psychologist who also happens to build software.

## Core Personality Traits

- **Practitioner-first credibility:** Everything is grounded in "I did this, it worked, here it is." Not theoretical. The founder scored 19% on his first practice exam, poured $1K into prep, passed first try. That story IS the brand. Never sounds like a marketing team — sounds like someone sharing what they built for themselves.

- **Anti-waste conviction:** Every piece of copy fights against wasted time, wasted money, wasted energy. "Study less. Score higher." / "Everything you need. Nothing you don't." / "fraction of the time, cost, and stress." The enemy is inefficiency — bloated $1,600 programs, dense unreadable textbooks, apps that crash.

- **Empathetic directness:** Acknowledges the struggle is real (burnout, debt, working full-time with kids, "one of the worst experiences of their professional career") but doesn't dwell in it. Moves quickly from "this sucks" to "here's what actually helps." Not warm-and-fuzzy — warm-and-useful.

- **Quiet confidence:** Makes strong claims without exclamation points. "We show you the highest-yield topics so every hour moves your score." Not "THE BEST EPPP PREP EVER!!!" Lets results and specifics do the talking. Numbers over adjectives.

- **Psychologist's precision with language:** Uses clinical terms naturally (ACT, MI, CBT-I, adaptive) because the audience knows them. Doesn't over-explain to the reader. Respects their intelligence. But also doesn't hide behind jargon — translates when it matters.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal <> Casual | Casual-professional | Contractions, fragments, but no slang. "We show you" not "We'll hook you up with." Feels like a well-written email from a colleague, not a text message or a brochure. |
| Serious <> Playful | Serious with dry wit | The subject is serious (careers, licensing, debt). Humor is subtle — "Questions People Actually Ask" instead of "FAQ." Never jokey. |
| Reserved <> Bold | Measured bold | Makes strong claims backed by specifics. "$100/mo" next to "$1,649 one-time." "Way more affordable... while still delivering higher-quality." Bold but factual, not hypey. |
| Simple <> Sophisticated | Simple words, sophisticated structure | Short sentences. Plain vocabulary. But the underlying logic is layered — the adaptive loop explanation is genuinely complex, delivered simply. |
| Warm <> Direct | Both — warm delivery, direct message | "Your AI coach helps you study what you actually need" is both caring and no-BS. Never cold, never mushy. |

## Vocabulary

**Words/phrases to USE:**
- "High-yield" — signature term, used repeatedly. Means "maximum score impact per hour studied."
- "Targeted" — replaces vague "personalized." Everything is precise, not generic.
- "Adaptive" — the key differentiator. The platform adapts; competitors don't.
- "Fraction of the time/cost/stress" — founder's origin-story phrase, reusable.
- "Actually" — "what you actually need," "what actually works." Implies competitors don't deliver.
- "Pass on your first try" — the promise. Specific, measurable, high-stakes.
- "Study less. Score higher." — the manifesto in four words.
- "Built by psychologists" — credibility anchor. Used in hero area and throughout.
- "Postdoc" — audience identifier. They're postdocs, not "students" or "users."
- Specific numbers: always. $1K, 19%, 588, 80+, $100/mo, 5-min, 10-min. Numbers > adjectives.
- "Knowledge gaps" — clinical and precise. What they're fixing.
- "Move your score" — active. The score is something you move, not something that happens to you.

**Words/phrases to AVOID:**
- "Comprehensive" / "robust" / "solution" — corporate vagueness
- "Passionate about" / "dedicated to" — empty filler
- "Revolutionary" / "game-changing" / "cutting-edge" — hype words (let the pricing and free trial speak for themselves)
- "Journey" — overused, vague
- "Unlock your potential" — motivational-poster energy
- "Best-in-class" — meaningless superlative
- "Leverage" / "optimize" / "synergy" — consultant-speak
- "We believe" — performative. Show, don't tell.
- "Easy" — studying for the EPPP is not easy. Saying "easy" undermines credibility. Say "efficient" or "frictionless" instead.
- "Students" — they're postdocs and early-career psychologists, not students.
- Exclamation points in marketing copy — one per page maximum. Confidence doesn't shout.

**Jargon level:** Moderate — uses clinical terms the EPPP audience already knows (ACT, MI, CBT-I, domains, vignettes) without explaining them. Translates technical AI concepts into plain language ("Your AI coach" not "our proprietary machine learning algorithm").

**Profanity:** Never. The audience is clinical psychologists pursuing licensure. Keep it professional.

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Short to medium. Heavy use of fragments for punch. Three-beat patterns are signature: "Study less. Score higher. Here's how." / "Time, cost, and stress." / "Innovative, effective, and affordable." Rarely exceeds 20 words.

**Paragraphs:** 1-2 sentences. Breathing room between ideas. Dense paragraphs = the enemy (that's what competitors do).

**Openings:** Bold claim or direct benefit. "A continuous loop that adapts to you." / "Study Efficiently Today." Never opens with a question. Never opens with "Welcome to..." or "At thePsychology.ai, we..."

**Transitions:** Minimal connective tissue. Jumps from point to point. Trusts the reader to follow.

**Formatting:** Short headers. Bullet points for features (with colon separators: "Learn: 80+ text + audio lessons"). Bold sparingly. No emojis in body copy (occasional in UI elements like scarcity messaging).

**Closing/CTAs:** Action-oriented, specific. "Claim Your Free Spot" not "Learn More." "Start Pro Today" not "Get Started" (although "Get Started" is used as a generic fallback). Best CTAs reference the value: "Claim Your Free Spot" implies scarcity + cost.

## POV & Address

**First person:** "We" for the platform, "I" for founder quotes. Never uses "one" or passive voice. The founder's "I" story is the trust anchor — first-person narrative that becomes "we built this for you."

**Reader address:** "You" and "your" — direct, personal. "Your AI coach," "your exact knowledge gaps," "your limited study time." Makes it about them.

**Relationship stance:** Guide who's been through it. Not a guru dispensing wisdom from above. Not a peer who's also struggling. A half-step ahead: "I was where you are. I found what works. Here it is." The tone of a senior postdoc talking to a junior one.

## Example Phrases

**On-brand (sounds like us):**
- "We show you the highest-yield topics so every hour moves your score."
- "Focus your limited study time on the topics that will move your score the most right now."
- "I poured $1K and a month into studying and passed on my first try."
- "Less filler, fewer random drills, more high-yield practice."
- "No credit card required."
- "Everything you need. Nothing you don't."
- "Turns dense theory into customized and clear examples."
- "Way more affordable than what's on the market while still delivering higher-quality practice."
- "Dive into tailored explanations that match your exact knowledge gaps."

**Off-brand (doesn't sound like us):**
- "Our revolutionary AI-powered platform leverages cutting-edge technology to transform your EPPP journey!" — Hype-laden, corporate, says nothing specific.
- "We're passionate about helping psychology students succeed." — Empty, "passionate" is banned, "students" is wrong audience term.
- "Getting started is easy! Just sign up and you'll be on your way." — Minimizes the challenge. "Easy" undermines credibility.
- "Join thousands of satisfied customers who love our comprehensive study solution." — Corporate testimonial-speak. No specifics.
- "Our team of experts has carefully curated the ultimate EPPP experience." — "Curated," "ultimate," "experience" = marketing-speak. Just say what it does.
- "Don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!" — Fake urgency. Our early-bird discount is real, never manufactured.

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature. "Move your score" > "adaptive algorithm."
- Use specific numbers. Always. $100/mo, 80+, 19%, 588, 5-min, 10-min.
- Acknowledge the pain honestly. Postdocs are broke, burned out, and time-starved. Say so.
- Let the founder's story do the trust-building. First-person narrative > third-person credibility claims.
- Contrast against competitors implicitly. "Less filler" implies others have filler. Don't need to name names (except in comparison content).
- Keep the mental health angle authentic. ACT, MI, CBT-I-based resets are a genuine differentiator. Don't make it fluffy — keep it clinical-practical.
- Frame price as an injustice corrected. $100/mo with a free trial vs $1,600 one-time isn't a "deal." It's proof the industry has been ripping people off.
- End with action. Every section should make clear what to do next.

**DON'T:**
- Don't be snarky about competitors by name on the landing page. Save that for comparison blog posts.
- Don't promise "easy." Promise efficient. Promise targeted. Promise less wasted time.
- Don't use manufactured urgency. The early-bird discount is real, lean on it. Never invent countdown timers or "limited time" offers that aren't true.
- Don't sound like a textbook. The whole point is that competitors' content is dense and dry. Ours can't be.
- Don't over-explain AI. The audience cares about outcomes, not architecture. "Your AI coach" is sufficient.
- Don't apologize or hedge. "We think this might help" = weak. "This is what works" = us.
- Don't forget the mental health angle. It's our most unique differentiator. Integrate it, don't silo it.
- Don't talk about the product without referencing the human behind it. Dr. Chan's story is the authenticity engine.

## Voice in Different Contexts

**Landing page:** Measured bold. Let numbers and testimonials do the heavy lifting. Short fragments. High contrast ($100/mo vs $1,600 one-time). Founder quote prominent.

**Blog/SEO content:** Slightly more explanatory, but still direct. Teacher-peer hybrid. Use "here's the thing" transitions. Always end with actionable takeaway + soft CTA.

**Email:** More personal. Lean into the "I" voice (from Dr. Chan). Conversational. One idea per email. Feels like a message from your study buddy who already passed.

**Social media:** Punchiest version. Lead with the pain point or the surprising fact. Forum-native tone for Reddit. Professional but warm for LinkedIn. Quick tips format for Instagram.

**Customer support/onboarding:** Warmest version. Still efficient, but more encouraging. "You've got this" energy without being patronizing.
