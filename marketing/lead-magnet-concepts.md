# Lead Magnet Concepts for thePsychology.ai

## Context
The product offers a 1-week free trial (then $100/mo, with early-bird discounts for early adopters), so the lead magnet captures email BEFORE someone is ready to create an account, builds trust, and makes thePsychology.ai the obvious choice when they're ready to commit to a prep program.

## Concept 1: The EPPP Prep Program Comparison Guide (RECOMMENDED)

- **The concept:** A 6-8 page PDF that objectively compares every major EPPP prep program — AATBS, PsychPrep, Taylor Study Method, Academic Review, and thePsychology.ai — across price, features, content quality, technology, and user reviews.

- **Format:** Downloadable PDF

- **The hook:** "EPPP Prep Programs Compared: The 2026 Guide (Price, Features, and What Real Users Say)"

- **Why someone would want this:** This is the #1 thing postdocs search for before choosing a program. Reddit threads asking "AATBS vs PsychPrep?" get dozens of replies. They're comparison-shopping and want someone to do the research for them. A free, thorough comparison guide is exactly what they need at this stage.

- **The bridge:** The guide is genuinely objective (includes competitor strengths), but the comparison naturally reveals thePsychology.ai's advantages: $100/mo vs $1,649 one-time, AI-adaptive vs static, wellness features that nobody else has. The final page transitions: "Ready to try the platform? Start your free week, no credit card required." They've already concluded it's the best option. The CTA just makes it easy.

- **Why this is #1:** It meets people exactly where they are in the buying journey. Someone searching "AATBS vs PsychPrep" is a high-intent lead — they've decided to study, they just haven't picked a program. This guide captures them at that decision point and removes all friction.

- **Implementation:** Low difficulty. 1-2 days of writing. Content: pricing table, feature comparison matrix, sourced user reviews from Reddit/SDN/forums (attributed), summary of strengths/weaknesses per program. Design: clean PDF, brand colors.

## Concept 2: The High-Yield EPPP Study Plan

- **The concept:** A structured 12-week EPPP study plan organized by domain, with recommended hours per week, which topics to study first (ordered by exam weighting), and a day-by-day schedule template.

- **Format:** Downloadable PDF + fillable schedule template

- **The hook:** "The 12-Week EPPP Study Plan: What to Study First, How Much, and Why"

- **Why someone would want this:** "How long should I study for the EPPP?" and "EPPP study schedule" are top search queries. Postdocs feel overwhelmed by the volume of material and don't know where to start. A structured plan eliminates decision paralysis and gives them a sense of control.

- **The bridge:** The study plan orders topics by yield (highest-impact domains first), which mirrors the platform's adaptive loop. The plan includes checkpoints: "After Week 4, take a practice diagnostic to recalibrate." Those practice diagnostics are what the platform provides. Natural transition: "Want adaptive tracking that adjusts this plan in real-time? That's what the platform does."

- **Implementation:** Low difficulty. 1-2 days. Requires knowledge of EPPP domain weightings (already in the platform's content). Fillable template can be Google Sheets or PDF.

## Concept 3: The EPPP Readiness Assessment

- **The concept:** A 15-question mini-quiz that assesses where someone stands across the 8 EPPP domains, gives them a readiness score, and identifies their top 3 weak domains with specific study recommendations.

- **Format:** Interactive quiz (Typeform, ScoreApp, or built-in)

- **The hook:** "How Ready Are You for the EPPP? Find Out in 3 Minutes"

- **Why someone would want this:** Anxiety about readiness is universal. "Am I ready?" is the question that keeps them up at night. An assessment gives them a concrete answer and an action plan. It also validates their effort ("you're strong in Assessment but need work in Bio Bases").

- **The bridge:** The quiz results naturally lead to: "Want to close those gaps? The platform adapts to your specific weak areas and focuses your study time there." The readiness score also creates a baseline — "retake this after 2 weeks on the platform to see your progress." This is the same diagnostic → adaptive loop the platform uses.

- **Bonus:** Quiz responses provide rich segmentation data. Someone weak in Research/Stats gets different email nurture than someone weak in Ethics. Enables personalized follow-up.

- **Implementation:** Medium difficulty. 2-3 days. Needs quiz platform or custom build. Questions need to be high-quality and actually diagnostic. Scoring logic needed. Personalized results page.

## Concept 4: The "19% to Passed" Method

- **The concept:** Dr. Chan's personal study framework in a 4-5 page PDF — the exact approach he used to go from scoring 19% on his first practice exam to passing the EPPP on his first try, with specific daily routines, time management tactics, and the mindset shifts that mattered.

- **Format:** PDF (letter-style, personal)

- **The hook:** "I Scored 19% on My First EPPP Practice Exam. Here's Exactly How I Passed on My First Try."

- **Why someone would want this:** The founder's story is the most powerful trust asset the brand has. Turning it into a standalone resource gives people a reason to engage before they're ready to sign up. It's also inherently shareable — postdocs forward it to each other in study groups. The 19% → passed arc is dramatic and relatable.

- **The bridge:** The PDF ends with: "This is the method I used manually. Then I built a platform that does it automatically." Everything in the framework (prioritize weak areas, practice under test conditions, take recovery breaks) maps directly to platform features (adaptive loop, exam simulation, Replenish). The reader sees the platform as the automated version of what worked.

- **Implementation:** Very low difficulty. 1 day. Dr. Chan writes or dictates his actual story and method. Minimal design needed — a personal letter format with a headshot is more authentic than a polished guide.

## Concept 5: Top 50 Most-Tested EPPP Topics

- **The concept:** A one-page cheat sheet listing the 50 highest-yield EPPP topics ordered by exam frequency, with the specific domain and sub-topic for each.

- **Format:** PDF (one-page, printable)

- **The hook:** "The 50 EPPP Topics That Show Up Most Often (Print This)"

- **Why someone would want this:** "What should I study?" is the core anxiety. A printable cheat sheet they can tape to their wall or keep in their notebook feels immediately valuable. It's also something they can't easily find elsewhere — most programs don't rank topics by exam frequency.

- **The bridge:** The cheat sheet tells them WHAT to study. The platform tells them HOW. "Know your top 50 topics? Now study them with adaptive lessons that match your gaps." Also: the cheat sheet doesn't include explanations or practice questions — for that, they need the platform.

- **Implementation:** Low difficulty. Half a day. Requires analysis of exam domain weightings and topic frequency (data the platform likely already has).

## Recommended Strategy

### Start with: Concept 1 (Comparison Guide)

**Why:**
1. Highest intent audience: they're already comparing programs
2. Captures people at the decision point (not awareness stage)
3. The comparison naturally positions thePsychology.ai as the winner
4. Reusable as SEO content (blog post version of the same comparison)
5. Low effort to create (pricing data + feature comparison + sourced reviews)
6. The free trial makes conversion friction minimal

### Then add: Concept 4 (The "19% to Passed" Method)

**Why:**
1. Fastest to create (Dr. Chan already has this story)
2. Most personal and shareable
3. Works well in social distribution (Reddit, Facebook groups)
4. Complements the comparison guide — one is rational, one is emotional

### Later: Concept 3 (Readiness Assessment)

**Why:**
1. Highest engagement format (quizzes convert 2-3x better than PDFs)
2. Provides segmentation data for email nurture
3. Requires more development time, so save for after the quick wins

## Implementation: Lead Magnet Landing Page

The lead magnet needs a dedicated landing page or a section on the homepage. Recommended approach:

**Option A: Exit-intent popup** — When a visitor is about to leave without signing up, show: "Not ready to start yet? Get the free EPPP Prep Comparison Guide."

**Option B: Blog sidebar/CTA** — On every blog post, a sticky CTA for the lead magnet.

**Option C: Dedicated /free-guide page** — Shareable link for social distribution.

**Option D: Homepage section** — Between the orbiting loop and pricing, a section: "Not sure which EPPP program to choose? Download the free comparison guide."

Recommended: Start with Option C (dedicated page) + Option B (blog CTAs). Add Option A (exit-intent) once you have the popup infrastructure.

## Email Capture Flow

1. Visitor downloads lead magnet (email captured)
2. Immediate delivery email with PDF attached
3. Nurture sequence begins (see email-sequences output)
4. Sequence addresses hesitations and builds toward platform signup
5. After signup, lead transitions to onboarding sequence
