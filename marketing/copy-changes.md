# Landing Page Copy Changes (Direct-Response Rewrite)

## Changes Made to `src/lib/config.tsx`

### Site Meta Description
- **Before:** "EPPP exam prep with targeted EPPP practice questions, sample exams, and high-yield study materials—built by psychologists to help you pass faster."
- **After:** "Free AI-adaptive EPPP exam prep — 80+ lessons, practice exams, and high-yield study materials built by psychologists who passed."
- **Why:** Adds "Free" (key differentiator) and "AI-adaptive" (mechanism). "Who passed" adds credibility vs generic "to help you pass faster."

### Hero Title
- **Before:** "Get EPPP-Ready"
- **After:** "Study Less. Pass the EPPP."
- **Why:** "Get EPPP-Ready" is generic — could be any prep program. "Study Less. Pass the EPPP." is contrarian (study LESS?), specific, and the brand's signature anti-waste positioning. The UserCountTicker above already establishes "free" + social proof, so the title adds the BENEFIT.

### Hero Description
- **Before:** "with"
- **After:** "Free AI-adaptive prep built by psychologists who scored 588."
- **Why:** "with" was a bridge word to the CompanyShowcase below, but too subtle for most visitors. New description hits three differentiators in one line: free, AI-adaptive, psychologist-built. The 588 score is specific credibility.

### Hero CTA
- **Before:** "Get Started"
- **After:** "Start Free"
- **Why:** "Start Free" is benefit-oriented (communicates the free trial). "Get Started" is generic, says nothing about what they're getting.

### Bento Section Title
- **Before:** "Examples"
- **After:** "What You Get"
- **Why:** "Examples" means nothing to a visitor. "What You Get" sets expectations and is benefit-forward.

### Bento Section Description
- **Before:** "Conversational demonstration"
- **After:** "80+ lessons. Adaptive quizzes. Exam simulation. And one feature no other EPPP program offers."
- **Why:** Specific feature count + curiosity seed ("one feature no other program offers") pointing to the Replenish/wellness feature below.

### Replenish Description
- **Before:** "Improve focus and reduce burnout while learning relevant EPPP topics (ACT, MI, and CBT-I)."
- **After:** "Evidence-based resets for focus and burnout. Built on ACT, MI, and CBT-I — techniques you'll use in practice."
- **Why:** "Techniques you'll use in practice" connects exam prep to their career — they're learning clinical skills WHILE studying. More resonant than just listing acronyms.

### Feature Section Description
- **Before:** "Comprehensive tools and resources designed specifically for EPPP success"
- **After:** "Multimodal, adaptive, and available whenever you are."
- **Why:** Removed banned word "comprehensive." New description is specific (multimodal, adaptive) and benefit-oriented (available whenever = 24/7 access for time-starved postdocs).

### Pricing Section Title
- **Before:** "Study Efficiently Today"
- **After:** "Claim Your Spot"
- **Why:** "Study Efficiently Today" is bland and doesn't create urgency. "Claim Your Spot" creates scarcity + action, aligning with the tiered pricing model (first 100 free → $20 → $50 → $100).

### Pricing Section Description
- **Before:** "Choose the plan that fits your prep style."
- **After:** "No credit card required. Start studying in 2 minutes."
- **Why:** Directly addresses the #1 signup friction point (cost/commitment fear). "2 minutes" adds speed/ease.

### CTA Section Title
- **Before:** "Study quickly and affordably"
- **After:** "Your license starts here"
- **Why:** "Study quickly and affordably" is features-talk. "Your license starts here" is transformation-talk — connects prep to the actual career outcome they want.

### CTA Section Button
- **Before:** "Start Pro Today"
- **After:** "Claim Your Free Spot"
- **Why:** "Start Pro Today" sounds like it costs money. "Claim Your Free Spot" communicates value and scarcity.

### CTA Section Subtext
- **Before:** "Free until Jan 31, 2026" (OUTDATED)
- **After:** "First 100 spots are free"
- **Why:** Previous date has passed. New subtext matches the current tiered scarcity model.

### FAQ Section Description
- **Before:** "FAQs"
- **After:** "Straight answers. No sales pitch."
- **Why:** "FAQs" adds nothing. "Straight answers. No sales pitch." matches the brand's anti-BS voice and sets expectations for honest, direct content.
