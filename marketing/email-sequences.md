Hey,

Your EPPP Prep Programs Compared guide is attached. [DOWNLOAD LINK]

Here's how to use it:

1. Check the pricing table on page 2 (you'll see why this matters)
2. Read the feature comparison on page 3
3. Look at the user reviews on page 5 — they're sourced from Reddit and Student Doctor Network

One thing you'll notice: every program claims to be "the best." But when you compare them side by side — price, adaptive technology, content quality, user satisfaction — the differences are stark.

Over the next couple of weeks, I'll send you a few emails about EPPP prep that I wish someone had sent me when I was studying. Practical stuff. No sales pitches.

Quick question: when is your exam date? Hit reply and let me know — it helps me send you the right info at the right time.

### Email 2: Founder's Story

**Send:** Day 2
**Subject:** I scored 19% on my first EPPP practice exam
**Preview:** Then I passed on my first try. Here's what happened in between.
**CTA:** Reply (engagement)

---

Quick story.

I scored 19% on my first EPPP practice diagnostic. Nineteen percent. I remember staring at the screen thinking "I spent 5 years getting a doctorate and I can't pass a multiple-choice test."

I panicked. I bought a $1,000 program. I studied every day for a month. Dense textbooks, endless question banks, apps that froze on me mid-session.

I passed on my first try.

But here's what bothered me: most of what I paid for was filler. Out of 1,000 pages of material, maybe 200 actually moved my score. The rest was noise.

I spent hours studying topics that appeared on maybe 2 questions. Meanwhile, I was under-prepared on domains that made up 15% of the exam.

After I passed, I couldn't stop thinking: what if there was a way to study ONLY the high-yield material? What if the platform adapted to what you actually needed instead of throwing everything at you?

That's why I built thePsychology.ai. Not as a business plan. As the tool I wished I'd had.

Tomorrow I'll share the specific study approach that took me from 19% to passing — the exact framework that's now built into the platform.

### Email 3: The Study Method

**Send:** Day 4
**Subject:** The study method that took me from 19% to passing
**Preview:** 4 steps. No filler.
**CTA:** Soft mention of platform

---

After I passed the EPPP, I reverse-engineered what actually worked. It came down to four things:

**1. Diagnose first, study second.**
I took a full practice diagnostic before I opened a single textbook. Most people start studying and hope for the best. I wanted to know exactly where I stood — which domains were strong, which were weak, and which had the most room to improve.

**2. Prioritize by yield, not by chapter order.**
My weakest domain was also one of the most heavily weighted on the exam. Improving there moved my score 3x more than improving a domain I was already decent at. I stopped studying in order and started studying by impact.

**3. Short quiz loops, not marathon reading sessions.**
I'd study a topic for 20-30 minutes, then quiz myself immediately. If I got it wrong, I'd re-study. If I got it right, I'd move on. This is basically spaced retrieval practice — the thing we learned about in grad school but never applied to our own studying.

**4. Recovery breaks that weren't just scrolling Instagram.**
EPPP burnout is real. I started doing 5-minute ACT-based exercises between study sessions — the same defusion and values clarification techniques I'd use with clients. It sounds obvious that a psychologist should use psychology on themselves, but I hadn't been doing it.

These four steps — diagnose, prioritize, quiz, recover — became the foundation of thePsychology.ai. The platform runs them automatically. Your AI coach identifies your gaps, prioritizes what to study, quizzes you to check retention, and offers evidence-based resets when you need them.

If you want to try the study loop yourself, you can start a free trial and take a practice diagnostic in about 10 minutes. No credit card required for the first week.

Or just keep using the comparison guide and these emails. Either way, I'll keep sharing what I know.

### Email 4: Address "Is Free Too Good to Be True?"

**Send:** Day 7
**Subject:** Why the platform costs a fraction of competitors (honest answer)
**Preview:** People ask me this constantly. Here's the real reason.
**CTA:** Start free trial

---

I get this question a lot: "Why is thePsychology.ai so much cheaper when AATBS charges $1,649?"

Fair question. Here's the honest answer.

When I was studying for the EPPP, I was a postdoc making $54K with $200K in student loans. A $1,649 study program felt like a cruel joke. I remember sitting in the AATBS checkout page and thinking: "This should not cost more than my car payment."

Most of us went into psychology to help people. We spent years in training, accepted low pay during internship and postdoc, and now we're being charged $1,000+ just to get licensed? For materials some of these companies haven't updated since the '90s?

That felt wrong.

So when I built thePsychology.ai, I made a decision: keep it accessible. The platform is $100/mo, and early adopters get a discount. You can try it for a full week before paying anything. No credit card required to start.

There's also a Pro + Coaching tier at $500/mo that includes 2 monthly calls with me for personalized study planning. But the core platform, 80+ lessons, practice exams, adaptive quizzes, the full study loop, that's $100/mo. For a 3-month study period, that's $300 total. AATBS starts at $999.

P.S. If you've been comparing programs and haven't decided yet, I understand. The 1-week free trial lets you experience everything before committing. Early adopters also get a discount on the monthly rate.

### Email 5: Social Proof

**Send:** Day 9
**Subject:** "This one comes the closest to how the EPPP actually words its questions"
**Preview:** What 3 users said (their words, not mine)
**CTA:** Start free trial

---

I could tell you the platform is good. But you'd expect me to say that — I built it.

So here's what other people say:

**Lorin Singh, PsyD:**
"It had information that I didn't see in Psych Prep. I did like that I was able to ask questions directly underneath the chapter for explanations."

**Anonymous User (from Reddit):**
"Out of all the programs I looked at, this one comes the closest to how the EPPP actually words its questions. My test didn't have any straight definition questions, it was all application based, and this program is set up the same way."

**Dr. Menon, Licensed Psychologist:**
"thePsychology.ai is truly one-of-a-kind. It's an innovative, effective, and affordable tool for EPPP preparation. The platform makes dense material feel engaging and manageable."

These aren't paid testimonials. These are clinicians who used the platform and told us what they thought.

The thing I'm most proud of is that second one — "the closest to how the EPPP actually words its questions." That's the whole point. Practice questions should prepare you for the real exam, not trick you with gotcha wording.

Want to see for yourself? Start a free trial and take a 10-minute practice quiz.

### Email 6: Time Scarcity (Real)

**Send:** Day 11
**Subject:** You don't have 15 hours a week to study
**Preview:** Neither did I. Here's what I did instead.
**CTA:** Start free trial

---

The standard advice for EPPP prep is: study 15-20 hours per week for 3-6 months.

If you're working full-time as a postdoc, that's basically your entire weekend plus evenings. If you have kids, a partner, any semblance of a life outside psychology — it's not happening.

I know because I tried.

Here's what actually worked: studying 6-8 hours per week, but making every hour count.

The difference wasn't discipline or intelligence. It was prioritization. When you study the highest-yield topics for YOUR specific gaps (not a generic study plan), you can cut study time by 40-50% without losing effectiveness.

That's what the adaptive loop does. The platform identifies your weak spots, focuses your study time there, and continuously adjusts as you improve. No wasted hours on topics you already know. No generic study plans that treat every domain equally when they're not.

One user put it this way: "I'm studying less but retaining more. The quizzes after each study session actually make things stick."

If you're working full-time and dreading the idea of 15+ hours a week of studying, this might help.

### Email 7: Last Email

**Send:** Day 14
**Subject:** Last email about this
**Preview:** Then back to regular programming
**CTA:** Start free trial (or unsubscribe gracefully)

---

This is the last email I'll send about the platform. After this, I'll move to weekly study tips — stuff that's useful whether you use thePsychology.ai or not.

Quick summary of what you get during the free trial week:

- Access to one lesson per EPPP domain (full adaptive functionality)
- Adaptive quizzes that target your specific weak areas
- Practice exam simulation (highlight, flag, timer, like the real thing)
- 5-minute evidence-based mental resets (ACT, MI, CBT-I)
- AI coach available 24/7

After the trial: $100/mo (early adopters get a discount). No credit card to start.

The one thing I'd ask: if you've been considering it, just try the practice diagnostic. It takes 10 minutes. You'll know immediately if this is useful for you.

[START YOUR FREE WEEK]

If now isn't the right time, that's fine. The weekly tips will keep coming. And if you change your mind later, the link above will still work (though the early-bird pricing won't last forever).

— Anders

P.S. If you know another postdoc studying for the EPPP, feel free to forward this email or share thepsychology.ai with them. The more people we can help, the better.

## Sequence 2: Welcome / Onboarding

**Trigger:** New account created
**Goal:** Activate the user — diagnostic exam, first lesson, Replenish feature
**Timing:** 5 emails over 10 days

---

### Email 1: Welcome + First Action

**Send:** Immediately after account creation
**Subject:** You're in. Here's your first move.
**Preview:** Takes 10 minutes. Changes everything.
**CTA:** Take the practice diagnostic

---

Welcome to thePsychology.ai.

Your account is live. Here's the one thing I'd do first:

**Take the practice diagnostic exam.**

It's about 10 minutes. It'll show you exactly where you stand across the EPPP domains — which ones are strong, which need work, and which will move your score the most.

This matters because the diagnostic is what activates the adaptive loop. Once the platform knows your gaps, it prioritizes everything — lessons, quizzes, study sessions — around what YOU specifically need.

Without the diagnostic, you're studying blind. With it, every minute is targeted.

[TAKE THE DIAGNOSTIC NOW]

After the diagnostic, here's what unlocks:
- Your personalized priority list (which domains to study first)
- Adaptive quizzes tailored to your weak areas
- Study sessions that match your exact knowledge gaps

One more thing: I read every reply to these emails. If you have questions about the platform, your study plan, or anything EPPP-related, just hit reply.

— Anders

---

### Email 2: Start First Lesson

**Send:** Day 2
**Subject:** Your priority list is ready
**Preview:** Start with the domain that moves your score the most.
**CTA:** Open the platform and start studying

---

If you've taken the diagnostic, your priority list is waiting for you.

Log in and you'll see your domains ranked by impact. The platform has already identified which topic will move your score the most right now.

Start there. Not chapter 1. Not the topic you find most interesting. The topic with the highest yield for YOUR specific gaps.

This is the core principle: study what matters most, not what comes first in the textbook.

Each lesson is designed to be completed in 15-25 minutes. Short enough to fit into a lunch break. Dense enough to actually move your understanding.

After the lesson, you'll get a short quiz to check retention. If you nail it, the platform moves you forward. If not, it adjusts and revisits the concept differently.

[OPEN YOUR PRIORITY LIST]

Haven't taken the diagnostic yet? No worries — [take it here]. It's the foundation for everything else.

### Email 3: Introduce Replenish

**Send:** Day 5
**Subject:** The feature nobody else has
**Preview:** Burnout is the real reason people fail the EPPP.
**CTA:** Try a Replenish session

---

Here's something I learned the hard way: EPPP failure isn't usually a knowledge problem. It's a burnout problem.

I talked to dozens of postdocs who failed. Smart people. Clinically excellent. They knew the material. But by exam day, they were so exhausted, anxious, and mentally depleted that they couldn't perform.

The irony isn't lost on me. We spend years learning about burnout, stress management, and mental health — then ignore all of it when we're studying for our own licensing exam.

That's why we built Replenish.

It's a 5-minute evidence-based reset built into the study flow. Not a meditation app. Not "take a deep breath." It's actual clinical techniques:

- **ACT-based defusion** — unhook from the "I'm going to fail" thoughts
- **Motivational Interviewing** — reconnect with why you're doing this
- **CBT-I principles** — protect your sleep during intense study periods

No other EPPP platform has anything like this.

Try one today. In the platform, look for "Replenish" in the menu. Pick a 5-minute session. See how you feel after.

[TRY A REPLENISH SESSION]

You're studying to be a psychologist. You might as well use psychology.

### Email 4: The Adaptive Loop

**Send:** Day 7
**Subject:** Why your study plan keeps changing (that's the point)
**Preview:** Static plans fail. Adaptive loops work.
**CTA:** Continue studying

---

You might have noticed: your priority list keeps shifting. Topics that were #1 last week might be #4 this week. New topics surface.

That's not a bug. That's the adaptive loop.

Here's how it works:

1. **Practice** — You take a diagnostic or quiz
2. **Prioritize** — The AI identifies your biggest gaps and ranks domains by impact
3. **Study** — You work through lessons targeted at those gaps
4. **Quiz** — Short adaptive quizzes check if the material stuck
5. **Repeat** — Results feed back into prioritization, and the loop continues

Every other EPPP program gives you a static plan: "Study Chapter 1 in Week 1, Chapter 2 in Week 2." That doesn't work because your brain isn't static. What you need changes as you learn.

The adaptive loop means your study plan is always current. Always targeted. Always focused on the thing that will move your score the most RIGHT NOW.

You don't need to manage it. Just keep studying, keep quizzing, and let the loop do the prioritization.

[CONTINUE YOUR STUDY SESSION]

— Anders

P.S. Quick tip: try to do at least one quiz after every study session. That's what keeps the loop calibrated.

### Email 5: Check-In + Quick Wins

**Send:** Day 10
**Subject:** How's it going?
**Preview:** Quick check-in + 3 tips from people who passed.
**CTA:** Reply (engagement) + continue studying

---

It's been about a week since you started. Quick check-in.

Three things that tend to make the biggest difference early on:

**1. Study in short bursts, not marathons.**
20-30 minute sessions with a quiz at the end beat 3-hour reading sessions. Your retention is dramatically better with shorter, focused blocks.

**2. Don't skip the domains you hate.**
If you're avoiding Research Methods or Bio Bases, those are probably your highest-yield domains. The uncomfortable topics are usually the ones that move your score the most.

**3. Use Replenish when you feel the drag.**
Studying through exhaustion doesn't work. A 5-minute reset between sessions is more productive than pushing through another hour of diminishing returns.

How are you feeling about your prep so far? Anything confusing, frustrating, or not working? Hit reply and let me know. I personally read every response.

P.S. If you're finding the platform useful, share it with a colleague who's also preparing. The more postdocs who have access to good prep, the better this field gets.

## Sequence 3: Coaching Upsell

**Trigger:** User has been active for 14+ days with at least 5 study sessions completed
**Goal:** Introduce Pro + Coaching ($500/mo)
**Timing:** 3 emails over 7 days

---

### Email 1: The Coaching Option

**Send:** Day 14 (after onboarding sequence)
**Subject:** Want a personalized roadmap?
**Preview:** What coaching adds to the platform.
**CTA:** Learn more about coaching

---

You've been using the platform for a couple weeks. By now you know how the adaptive loop works, and you've probably noticed some domains improving.

I wanted to let you know about something that accelerates the process: Pro + Coaching.

It's everything in the free platform, plus:

- **2 x 45-minute calls per month with me** (Dr. Chan)
- **A custom study roadmap** based on your exam date, schedule, and diagnostic results
- **Priority support** — questions answered within hours, not days
- **Accountability** — I track your progress and adjust the plan between calls

The calls are where we dig into your specific situation. Which domains to prioritize based on your learning style. How to manage study time around your job and life. What to do when you hit a wall on a topic.

It's $500/month. For context, most EPPP coaches charge $150-300/month for less — and they cancel appointments.

This isn't for everyone. The free platform is designed to be complete on its own. But if you want a personalized strategy and someone in your corner, coaching makes a meaningful difference.

No pressure. The free platform isn't going anywhere.

### Email 2: Who Coaching Is For

**Send:** Day 17
**Subject:** Is coaching worth it? (Honest take)
**Preview:** It depends on your situation.
**CTA:** Book a coaching intro call

---

A few people have asked: "Is coaching worth $500/month?"

Here's my honest take: it depends.

**Coaching makes the biggest difference if:**
- Your exam is in 2-3 months and you need to be strategic about every study hour
- You're working full-time and need a plan that fits your actual schedule (not a generic 15hr/week plan)
- You've failed the EPPP before and need a different approach
- You study inconsistently and need external accountability
- You have specific domains that aren't improving despite studying

**You probably don't need coaching if:**
- You're self-directed and consistent
- Your exam is 6+ months away and you have time to self-correct
- The adaptive loop is working well for you without guidance
- You're on a tight budget (the free platform is genuinely sufficient)

I don't want to oversell this. The platform is designed to work without coaching. But coaching compresses the timeline and eliminates guesswork.

If you're curious, we can do a 15-minute intro call (free) to see if it makes sense for your situation.

Either way, keep studying. You're making progress.

### Email 3: Last Mention

**Send:** Day 21
**Subject:** One more thing, then I'll stop
**Preview:** Quick math on coaching.
**CTA:** Book intro call or continue free

---

Last email about coaching, then back to study tips.

Quick math:

- Most EPPP programs: $700 - $1,649 (one-time)
- Most EPPP coaches: $150-300/month (on top of the program fee)
- Combined cost: $1,000-$2,000+ over 3-6 months

Pro + Coaching at thePsychology.ai: $500/month.

That includes the full platform (which is otherwise free) PLUS personalized coaching. For a typical 3-month prep period, that's $1,500 total — less than AATBS alone, with coaching included.

But again: the free platform is complete. You don't need coaching to pass. Think of it as the difference between going to the gym with a trainer versus without one. Both work. The trainer is faster.
