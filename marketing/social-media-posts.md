### Reddit Post 1 — r/psychologystudents
**Target subreddit:** r/psychologystudents
**Title:** I scored 19% on my first EPPP practice test. Here's what I changed to pass on my first attempt.

When I took my first practice diagnostic, I got 19%. Not a typo. Nineteen percent. I genuinely considered whether I'd chosen the wrong career.

But I ended up passing on my first try with a 588. Here's what actually made the difference — not what the prep companies tell you, but what I figured out after weeks of doing it wrong.

**1. I stopped studying "evenly" across all domains.**
Most people give equal time to all 8 domains. That's a mistake. Some domains are worth more, and some you're already decent at. I took a diagnostic first, ranked my weakest areas, and spent 70% of my study time there. Sounds obvious in hindsight. Almost nobody does it.

**2. I cut my study hours in half.**
I was doing 15-20 hours a week at first. Passive reading, highlighting, re-reading. Classic. I switched to 6-8 hours of focused, quiz-based studying and my scores went up faster than when I was grinding 15+. Active recall and spaced repetition aren't just buzzwords — they're the entire game.

**3. I studied my mistakes, not just the content.**
After every practice quiz, I'd spend more time reviewing what I got wrong than I spent taking the quiz itself. I'd write out WHY I picked the wrong answer — was it a content gap, a misread, or a trick? Different causes need different fixes.

**4. I treated sleep and recovery like part of the study plan.**
I know, I know. But consolidation is real. I stopped pulling late sessions and started protecting 7+ hours of sleep. My retention on Monday was noticeably better when I'd actually rested over the weekend.

**5. I stopped reading the textbook cover to cover.**
The EPPP doesn't test whether you read the book. It tests whether you can apply concepts under pressure. I switched almost entirely to practice questions with targeted review of weak spots. If I couldn't answer a question, THEN I'd go read the relevant section.

The whole process took me about 4 months at 6-8 hours/week while working full-time. It's doable. You just have to stop doing the thing that feels productive (passive reading) and start doing the thing that actually is (active testing).

Happy to answer questions if anyone's in the middle of prep right now.

### Reddit Post 2 — r/ClinicalPsychology
**Target subreddit:** r/ClinicalPsychology
**Title:** For anyone who just failed the EPPP — a concrete recovery plan from someone who almost didn't take it

I've talked to a lot of people who failed the EPPP, and the first thing most of them say is some version of "I'm not smart enough" or "maybe I'm not cut out for this."

Let's address that directly: the fail rate is around 24%. That's roughly 1 in 4. You're not an outlier. You're not broken. You're in a large group of competent people who got tripped up by a test that rewards a very specific kind of preparation.

Here's what I'd actually do if I were starting over after a fail:

**Week 1-2: Don't study. Process it.**
We literally teach our clients about cognitive distortions. Time to apply it. "I failed the EPPP" is not the same as "I'm a failure." Catastrophizing, overgeneralization, labeling — notice them. Sit with the disappointment without letting it become an identity.

**Week 3: Diagnose what actually went wrong.**
Take a fresh diagnostic under test conditions. Not to torture yourself — to get data. Most people who fail fall into one of three buckets:
- Content gaps in 2-3 specific domains (most common)
- Test anxiety that tanks performance below actual knowledge level
- Study method was passive (reading/highlighting instead of active recall)

Each of these has a completely different fix. You need to know which one you're dealing with.

**Week 4+: Rebuild with a targeted plan.**
If it's content gaps — focus 70% of your time on your 2-3 weakest domains. Don't re-study everything equally.
If it's test anxiety — practice under timed conditions regularly. Desensitize yourself to the pressure.
If it's method — switch to quiz-based studying. Active recall, spaced repetition, mistake analysis.

**Set a realistic timeline.**
3 months if you're studying full-time. 4-6 months if you're working. 6-8 hours per week of focused study is enough if you're doing it right.

The people who pass on their second attempt almost always say the same thing: "I didn't study more. I studied differently."

You've already proven you can get through a doctoral program. This test is learnable. It just requires a different approach than what got you through school.

### Reddit Post 3 — r/psychologystudents
**Target subreddit:** r/psychologystudents
**Title:** Honest comparison of EPPP prep options after trying multiple approaches

I spent way too much time researching EPPP prep before I finally just committed to a method. Figured I'd share what I found for anyone currently paralyzed by the options.

**AATBS** — The big name. $1,649 for their full program. The content is comprehensive but honestly painfully dry. The core material hasn't fundamentally changed since the company started in 1976. It works for some people, but if you struggle with dense academic reading, you're going to have a rough time staying engaged. A lot of people buy it and don't finish it.

**PsychPrep** — Decent question bank, but multiple people (including me) noticed some questions felt like they were designed to trick you rather than test your knowledge. There's a difference between a challenging question and a misleading one. The EPPP is already hard enough without your prep material adding confusion.

**Taylor Study Method** — Coaching-based approach, which is actually a solid concept. The problem I kept hearing about was scheduling issues and coaches canceling. When you're working full-time and carving out specific hours to prep, reliability matters.

**Self-study with textbooks** — Free, obviously. Can work if you're extremely self-disciplined and already have a strong foundation. The risk is you don't know what you don't know, and there's no adaptive feedback telling you where to focus.

**What actually mattered more than which program I chose:**
- Taking a diagnostic FIRST to know where I was weak
- Prioritizing domains by weight and weakness, not studying everything equally
- Doing active practice questions instead of passive reading
- Reviewing mistakes systematically
- Keeping study hours reasonable (6-8/week) instead of burning out at 15-20

The specific tool matters less than the method. If your approach is "read everything and hope for the best," even the most expensive program won't save you. If your approach is diagnostic-driven and quiz-heavy, you can pass with almost any resource.

### Reddit Post 4 — r/ClinicalPsychology
**Target subreddit:** r/ClinicalPsychology
**Title:** How I studied for the EPPP while working full-time (sample schedule included)

Every EPPP guide says "dedicate 15-20 hours per week." Cool. When exactly? Between my full caseload, notes, supervision, and trying to maintain basic human functions?

Here's what I actually did. 6-8 hours per week. Passed first try.

**Monday-Friday: ~1 hour/day, broken into chunks**
- Morning (before work): 25 min focused quiz session. Coffee + practice questions. No reading, just active recall.
- Lunch break: 15 min on phone reviewing questions I got wrong that morning. Just the explanations, not new content.
- Commute (if applicable): Audio content review. Not a replacement for studying, but decent for passive reinforcement.

**Saturday: 2-hour deep session**
- Review the week's weak spots
- Take a longer timed practice section (50 questions)
- Analyze mistakes in detail

**Sunday: Off.**
Non-negotiable. Rest is part of the plan, not a deviation from it.

**Time-finding strategies that actually worked:**
1. Morning block before work — your brain is freshest, no decision fatigue yet
2. Lunch quizzes — 15 minutes is enough for 8-10 questions with review
3. Batching errands — I did all my admin/chores on one evening to free up other evenings
4. Saying no to things for 3-4 months — temporary sacrifice, not permanent lifestyle change
5. Protecting sleep — I know it seems counterintuitive when you're short on time, but cutting sleep to study is borrowing from tomorrow's performance to fund today's. Bad trade.

The myth that you need 15-20 hours comes from passive study methods. If you're reading and highlighting, yeah, you need that many hours because the method is inefficient. If you're doing diagnostic-driven, quiz-based studying with targeted review, 6-8 hours is genuinely enough.

I tracked my hours. Total prep time over 4 months was roughly 120 hours. Not 400. Not 600. A hundred and twenty.

### LinkedIn Post 1 — The Origin Story

I scored 19% on my first EPPP practice test.

Not a typo.

I remember staring at the screen thinking I'd wasted 5 years of my life.

But here's the thing about that moment —
it was actually the most useful data point in my entire prep.

Because it told me exactly where I stood.
No ego. No guessing. Just numbers.

From there, I built a plan:
- Identified my 3 weakest domains
- Spent 70% of my time there
- Switched from passive reading to active quizzing
- Cut my study hours from 15/week to 6-8

Four months later, I passed on my first attempt. Scored 588.

The difference wasn't talent or intelligence.
It was method.

Most EPPP candidates study hard.
Very few study strategically.

That experience is why I built thePsychology.ai — because I kept thinking, why did I have to figure this out by accident? Why isn't every prep platform built around diagnostics and adaptive learning from day one?

If you're preparing for the EPPP right now, the single best thing you can do today is take an honest diagnostic. Not to feel bad about your score. To build a plan that actually works.

What's the biggest challenge you're facing with EPPP prep?

### LinkedIn Post 2 — The Comparison Angle

The most popular EPPP prep program costs $1,649.

Its core content was written in 1976.

I want to be respectful — it's helped a lot of people pass. But I also think we should talk about what "helped" means when 24% of test-takers still fail.

Here's what I noticed when I was comparing options:

Traditional programs give you content and say "learn this."
They don't diagnose where you're weak.
They don't adapt to your progress.
They don't prioritize domains by exam weight AND your gaps.

It's like going to a doctor who prescribes the same treatment to every patient regardless of symptoms.

We would never accept that in clinical practice.
Why do we accept it in exam prep?

When I built thePsychology.ai, the first feature wasn't a question bank.
It was a diagnostic engine.

Because the question was never "do you have enough content?"
The question was "are you studying the right things, in the right order, with the right method?"

Turns out, when you answer that question well, people need fewer hours to pass.
6-8 per week instead of 15-20.

Study less. Score higher.
Not a tagline. A methodology.

What's your experience been with EPPP prep programs? I'd genuinely like to hear.

### LinkedIn Post 3 — The Failure Post

24% of EPPP test-takers fail.

That's roughly 1 in 4 people who completed a doctoral program in psychology.

These aren't people who didn't try hard enough.
These are people who survived comprehensive exams, dissertations, 3,000+ practicum hours.

When they fail, most of them say some version of:
"Maybe I'm not cut out for this."

And here's where it gets ironic.

We spend years learning to identify cognitive distortions in our clients.
Catastrophizing. Overgeneralization. Labeling.

Then we fail a test and immediately apply every single one to ourselves.

"I failed the EPPP" becomes "I'm a failure."
One data point becomes a life sentence.

If you've failed the EPPP, here's what the data actually shows:

Most people who fail had a method problem, not a knowledge problem.
The three most common causes are:
→ Content gaps in 2-3 specific domains (fixable in weeks)
→ Test anxiety reducing performance below actual ability
→ Passive study methods (reading instead of active recall)

Each one has a different solution.
None of them is "you're not smart enough."

The people who pass on their second attempt almost always say the same thing:
"I didn't study more. I studied differently."

If you're recovering from a fail right now — take two weeks off. Process it.
Then take a diagnostic and build a real plan.

You didn't get through a doctoral program by accident.

### LinkedIn Post 4 — The Working Professional

"How many hours per week should I study for the EPPP?"

Every guide says 15-20 hours.

I want to push back on that number.

Because it assumes passive studying — reading textbooks, highlighting, re-reading notes.

When I was prepping, I tried that approach first.
15+ hours a week. Exhausted. Scores barely moved.

Then I switched to 6-8 hours of focused, active study:
→ Practice questions (not reading)
→ Mistake analysis (not just checking answers)
→ Targeted review of weak domains (not equal time everywhere)
→ Protected sleep and recovery

My scores improved faster in 3 weeks of 6-8 hours
than they had in 6 weeks of 15-20.

Here's a rough weekly breakdown that worked for me while working full-time:

Mon-Fri: 25 min morning quiz + 15 min lunch review = ~5 hrs
Saturday: 2-hour deep practice session
Sunday: Rest

Total: ~7 hours.

The people who tell you to study 15-20 hours a week
are measuring effort.

The EPPP measures performance.

Those are different things.

## FACEBOOK GROUPS (4 posts)

### Facebook Post 1 — The Study Plan Share

**For EPPP study groups**

Hey everyone. I passed the EPPP a while back and wanted to share the actual study plan I used, in case it helps anyone here.

Quick background: I was working full-time, had about 4 months to prep, and could realistically do 6-8 hours per week. Here's what worked for me.

**The 4-Step Loop (repeated weekly):**

Step 1 — DIAGNOSE: Take a practice quiz at the start of each week to see where you actually stand. Not where you think you stand. Where the data says you stand.

Step 2 — PRIORITIZE: Rank your domains by (exam weight) x (how weak you are). Spend 70% of your weekly hours on your bottom 2-3 domains.

Step 3 — QUIZ: Do practice questions, not reading. For every question you get wrong, write down WHY you got it wrong. Content gap? Misread? Trick wording? The fix is different for each.

Step 4 — RECOVER: Protect your sleep. Take Sundays off. Consolidation is real — your brain needs downtime to retain what you studied.

**Domain priority order (based on exam weight):**
1. Clinical Psychology
2. Biological Bases of Behavior
3. Social & Multicultural Bases
4. Cognitive-Affective Bases
5. Growth & Lifespan Development
6. Assessment & Diagnosis
7. Research Methods & Statistics
8. Treatment/Intervention & Prevention
9. Ethical/Legal/Professional Issues

But adjust based on YOUR diagnostic. If you're already strong in Clinical but weak in Research Methods, flip your time allocation.

**Timeline options:**
- 3-month intensive (if not working): 10-12 hrs/week
- 4-month plan (working full-time): 6-8 hrs/week
- 6-month plan (lighter load): 4-6 hrs/week

Any of these can work. The method matters more than the hours.

Happy to answer questions about any of this.

### Facebook Post 2 — The Mistakes Post

**For EPPP study groups**

5 study mistakes I made before I figured out what actually works for the EPPP. Sharing so you don't waste the same weeks I did.

**Mistake 1: Studying all domains equally.**
I gave each domain the same amount of time. Felt fair and thorough. But some domains are worth significantly more on the exam, and I was already decent in some areas. Once I started weighting my time by (exam importance) x (my weakness), my scores jumped.

**Mistake 2: Reading the textbook cover to cover.**
I spent 3 weeks doing this before I realized my practice scores hadn't moved at all. The EPPP doesn't test whether you read the book. It tests whether you can apply concepts. I switched to quiz-first studying and only read sections when I couldn't answer related questions.

**Mistake 3: Not reviewing WHY I got questions wrong.**
I used to just check the answer, think "oh right," and move on. That's not learning. When I started writing down the specific reason I missed each question — content gap, misread, eliminated wrong option — my error rate dropped significantly.

**Mistake 4: Studying 15+ hours a week and burning out.**
I thought more hours = more prepared. I was exhausted, retaining less, and starting to dread studying. Cutting to 6-8 focused hours felt scary but my scores actually improved faster.

**Mistake 5: Ignoring sleep and recovery.**
I'd stay up late doing "one more chapter." Then I'd be foggy the next day and retain nothing. When I started protecting 7+ hours of sleep and taking full days off, my weekly retention was noticeably better.

The short version: study less, study smarter, sleep more. It sounds too simple but the data backs it up.

### Facebook Post 3 — The After-Failure Support

**For EPPP study groups**

If you recently got your score back and it wasn't what you needed — this post is for you.

First: 24% of people fail the EPPP. Nearly 1 in 4. You are not alone, and this does not mean what your brain is telling you it means right now.

I know that's hard to hear in this moment. The shame and self-doubt after failing a licensing exam is brutal, especially when you just spent years proving you can do this work.

Here's what I'd suggest, based on what I've seen work for people who passed on their second attempt:

**Weeks 1-2: Don't study.**
Give yourself permission to be disappointed without trying to fix it immediately. Talk to someone. Journal. Do whatever you'd tell a client to do if they experienced a setback. We know how to do this — we just forget to apply it to ourselves.

**Week 3: Get diagnostic data.**
Take a full-length practice test under real conditions. Not to punish yourself — to figure out what actually happened. Most people who fail have issues in 2-3 specific domains, not across the board.

**Week 4 onward: Build a targeted plan.**
Focus on your actual weak areas. Switch to active recall methods if you were mostly reading before. Keep hours at 6-8 per week — burnout is what got a lot of people in trouble the first time.

The most important thing: this is a method problem, not a you problem. The people who pass on attempt two don't suddenly become smarter. They change their approach.

You got through a doctoral program. You can get through this.

Sending support to everyone in this boat right now.

### Facebook Post 4 — The Working Full-Time Post

**For EPPP study groups**

For everyone studying for the EPPP while working full-time — here's the weekly schedule I actually used. No "just study 15-20 hours a week" nonsense.

**My real schedule (6-8 hours/week):**

MONDAY-FRIDAY:
- 6:00-6:25 AM — 25 min practice quiz before work (coffee mandatory)
- 12:15-12:30 PM — 15 min reviewing wrong answers from morning quiz
- That's it on weekdays. ~3 hrs 20 min total.

SATURDAY:
- 9:00-11:00 AM — 2 hour deep session. Timed practice section (50 questions) + detailed mistake review.

SUNDAY:
- Nothing. Rest day. Non-negotiable.

**Weekly total: ~5.5-7 hours**

**Strategies that helped me find the time:**

1. Morning block before work — brain is fresh, no willpower needed because it's the first thing you do
2. Lunch quiz on phone — 15 min is enough for 8-10 questions plus review
3. Batch all errands/admin to one weeknight to free up others
4. Audio review during commute if you drive (supplemental, not primary study)
5. Protect sleep above all — 7+ hours minimum. Cutting sleep to study is counterproductive. Memory consolidation happens during sleep. This isn't wellness fluff, it's neuroscience.

The key insight for me: 6-8 focused hours of active studying (quizzing, mistake review, targeted content) beats 15-20 hours of passive reading. Every time.

I did this for 4 months. Total study time: roughly 120 hours. Passed first try.

It's not about having more time. It's about using the time you have on the right things.

### Instagram Carousel 1 — "I Scored 19% on My First EPPP Practice Test"

**Caption:**
I scored 19% on my first EPPP practice test. Four months later, I passed on my first try. Here's exactly what changed. Save this if you're prepping for the EPPP right now.

#EPPP #EPPPprep #psychologyexam #psychologystudent #licensedpsychologist #psychologylife #examprep #studytips #Psy.D

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
I scored 19% on my first EPPP practice test.

Here's how I passed on my first try.

**Slide 2:**
THE STARTING POINT

First diagnostic score: 19%
Final exam score: 588 (passed)
Time to prepare: 4 months
Hours per week: 6-8

**Slide 3:**
STEP 1: DIAGNOSE

I took a full practice diagnostic before studying anything.

Not to feel bad about the score.
To find out exactly where I was weak.

You can't fix what you haven't measured.

**Slide 4:**
STEP 2: PRIORITIZE

I ranked every domain by:
(exam weight) x (how weak I was)

Then spent 70% of my study time
on my bottom 2-3 domains.

Most people study all domains equally.
That's why most people waste time.

**Slide 5:**
STEP 3: SWITCH TO ACTIVE RECALL

I stopped reading the textbook.
I started doing practice questions.

For every wrong answer, I wrote down
WHY I got it wrong:
- Content gap?
- Misread?
- Trick wording?

Different problems need different fixes.

**Slide 6:**
STEP 4: CUT MY HOURS IN HALF

Before: 15-20 hrs/week of reading
Result: Scores barely moved

After: 6-8 hrs/week of active quizzing
Result: Scores improved faster

More hours does not equal more learning.

**Slide 7:**
STEP 5: PROTECT RECOVERY

7+ hours of sleep. Every night.
Full rest day every Sunday.

Memory consolidation happens during sleep.
Not during your 11 PM study session.

**Slide 8:**
THE RESULTS

19% → 588
15 hrs/week → 6-8 hrs/week
Passive reading → Active quizzing
Study everything → Study weak spots
Grind harder → Study smarter

**Slide 9:**
THE METHOD (summary)

1. Take a diagnostic first
2. Prioritize by weight x weakness
3. Quiz, don't read
4. Analyze every mistake
5. Protect sleep and rest

Study less. Score higher.

### Instagram Carousel 2 — "EPPP Prep Programs Compared"

**Caption:**
I compared every major EPPP prep program before I took the exam. Here's what I found — the good, the bad, and what actually matters more than which program you pick.

#EPPP #EPPPprep #psychologystudent #examprep #psychologylife #studytips

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
EPPP Prep Programs Compared

What nobody tells you before you spend $1,649.

**Slide 2:**
AATBS — The Big Name

Cost: $1,649
Pros: Comprehensive content
Cons: Core material from 1976.
Painfully dry for most learners.
Many people buy it and don't finish.

**Slide 3:**
PSYCHPREP

Cost: Mid-range
Pros: Decent question bank
Cons: Some questions feel designed
to trick you, not test you.

There's a difference between
"challenging" and "misleading."

**Slide 4:**
TAYLOR STUDY METHOD

Cost: Mid-range
Pros: Coaching-based (good concept)
Cons: Scheduling issues.
Coaches canceling sessions.

When you're working full-time,
reliability matters.

**Slide 5:**
SELF-STUDY WITH TEXTBOOKS

Cost: Free
Pros: No financial barrier
Cons: No adaptive feedback.
You don't know what you don't know.
Requires extreme self-discipline.

**Slide 6:**
HERE'S THE REAL ISSUE

Most programs give you content and say
"learn this."

They don't:
→ Diagnose where you're weak
→ Adapt to your progress
→ Prioritize by exam weight + your gaps

Same treatment for every patient.
We'd never accept that clinically.

**Slide 7:**
WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE PROGRAM

1. Diagnostic-first approach
2. Active recall over passive reading
3. Time weighted to weak domains
4. Systematic mistake review
5. Sustainable hours (6-8/week)

**Slide 8:**
THE COMPARISON

Traditional prep:
15-20 hrs/week. $1,649. One-size-fits-all.

Diagnostic-driven prep:
6-8 hrs/week. Adaptive. Personalized.

Same exam. Different results.

**Slide 9:**

### Instagram Carousel 3 — "What to Do After Failing the EPPP"

**Caption:**
24% of people fail the EPPP. If that was you — this is your recovery plan. No toxic positivity. No "just study harder." Actual steps from someone who works with EPPP candidates every day.

#EPPP #EPPPprep #examfailure #psychologystudent #mentalhealth #psychologylife

**Slide 1 (Cover):**
You failed the EPPP.

Here's your actual recovery plan.

**Slide 2:**
FIRST: THE NUMBERS

24% fail rate.
That's nearly 1 in 4.

These are people who completed
doctoral programs in psychology.

You are not an outlier.
You are not broken.

**Slide 3:**
THE IRONY

We spend years learning to spot
cognitive distortions in clients.

Then we fail a test and immediately:
- Catastrophize
- Overgeneralize
- Label ourselves

"I failed the EPPP" is not
"I'm a failure."

**Slide 4:**
WEEKS 1-2: DON'T STUDY

Process the disappointment.
Talk to someone.
Do what you'd tell a client to do.

You cannot build a good study plan
on top of unprocessed shame.

**Slide 5:**
WEEK 3: DIAGNOSE

Take a full diagnostic under test conditions.

Not to punish yourself.
To collect data.

You need to know WHAT went wrong
before you can fix it.

**Slide 6:**
THE 3 MOST COMMON CAUSES

1. Content gaps in 2-3 specific domains
   (most common — fixable in weeks)

2. Test anxiety reducing performance
   below actual knowledge

3. Passive study methods
   (reading instead of active recall)

Each one has a different fix.

**Slide 7:**
WEEK 4+: REBUILD

Content gaps → Focus 70% on weakest domains
Test anxiety → Practice under timed conditions
Bad method → Switch to quiz-based studying

Set a timeline: 3-6 months.
Keep hours at 6-8/week.
Burnout may be what caused this.

**Slide 8:**
WHAT SECOND-ATTEMPT PASSERS SAY

"I didn't study more.
I studied differently."

Almost every single one.

**Slide 9:**
REMEMBER

You survived comprehensive exams.
You completed a dissertation.
You logged 3,000+ practicum hours.

A licensing exam does not undo that.

This is a method problem.
Not a you problem.

**Slide 2:**
THE MYTH

"Study 15-20 hours per week."

That number assumes passive studying:
reading, highlighting, re-reading.

If your method is active,
you need half the hours.

**Slide 3:**
THE DAILY ROUTINE (Mon-Fri)

6:00 AM — 25 min practice quiz

SUNDAY
Nothing. Full rest day.
Non-negotiable.

**Slide 5:**
WEEKLY TOTAL

Weekdays: ~3.5 hrs
Saturday: ~2 hrs
Sunday: 0 hrs

Total: ~5.5-7 hours

Over 4 months: ~120 total hours.

**Slide 6:**
5 TIME-FINDING STRATEGIES

1. Morning block (brain is freshest)
2. Lunch quiz (15 min = 8-10 questions)
3. Batch errands to one evening
4. Audio review during commute
5. Say no to things for 3-4 months

**Slide 7:**
THE NON-NEGOTIABLE

Sleep 7+ hours. Every night.

Memory consolidation happens during sleep.
Cutting sleep to study is borrowing
from tomorrow to fund today.

Bad trade.

**Slide 8:**
THE COMPARISON

Passive method:
15-20 hrs/week. 6 months. Exhausted.

Active method:
6-8 hrs/week. 4 months. Sustainable.

Same exam. Better results. Less suffering.

**Slide 9:**
THE KEY INSIGHT

It's not about having more time.

It's about using the time you have
on the right things:
→ Practice questions, not reading
→ Weak domains, not everything equally
→ Mistake analysis, not just answer-checking
