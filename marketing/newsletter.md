# The 588 — Weekly Newsletter from thePsychology.ai

---

## Part 1: Newsletter Format Template

### Name: **The 588**

Why: 588 is Dr. Chan's EPPP passing score. It's a number, not a word — which fits the brand's "numbers over adjectives" principle. It's memorable, specific, and carries a story. Every subscriber will eventually learn what 588 means, and it becomes shorthand for "from struggling to licensed."

### Frequency

Weekly. Sent Tuesday mornings, 9am recipient local time. Tuesday avoids Monday inbox overload and Friday check-out energy.

### Approximate Length

800-1,200 words. Readable in 4-6 minutes. Short enough to finish during a coffee break, long enough to deliver real value.

### Structure (Repeating Sections)

Each edition follows this format:

1. **The Score** (50-100 words)
   One opening thought — a personal observation, a reframe on studying, or a question worth sitting with. Sets the tone. Written in first person from Anders.

2. **High-Yield** (300-500 words)
   The main content section. One EPPP topic broken down for maximum retention. Could be a domain deep-dive, a concept comparison, a decision-tree walkthrough, or a vignette-style analysis. This is the reason people open the email.

3. **The 5-Minute Edge** (100-150 words)
   One concrete, actionable study tip they can use immediately. Not theory. Not motivation. A specific technique, schedule adjustment, or practice approach.

4. **From the Platform** (50-75 words)
   A brief, non-salesy mention of something relevant on thePsychology.ai — a new lesson, a quiz related to the week's topic, a feature they might not know about. Framed as "if you want to go deeper" rather than "sign up now."

5. **Next Week** (1 sentence)
   A teaser for the next edition's High-Yield topic. Creates a reason to stay subscribed.

### Tone Guidelines (Newsletter-Specific)

- More personal than the landing page, more structured than a casual email
- First person throughout. This is Anders writing to you, not "the team"
- One idea per edition. No link dumps, no "5 things you missed this week"
- Clinical accuracy matters. If a concept is discussed, it should be correct enough that a licensed psychologist wouldn't object
- No urgency language. No "limited time" or "don't miss out." The value should make them want to open it
- Treat the reader as a colleague, not a lead

### Subject Line Formula

Pattern: **[Specific EPPP topic or number] + [unexpected angle or implication]**

Examples:
- "The EPPP question most people get wrong about informed consent"
- "Piaget vs. Vygotsky: the 3-question framework"
- "Why 500 is not a passing score"
- "The domain worth 15% of your exam that gets 5% of your study time"
- "One vignette, four possible answers, zero obvious ones"
- "What your diagnostic score actually tells you"

Avoid: Questions in subject lines. "You won't believe" framing. All caps. Emojis.

**Subject:** The EPPP domain nobody studies enough (and it's 15% of the exam)
**Preview text:** Plus a retrieval practice technique that takes 3 minutes.

Hey,

Welcome to The 588.

This is a weekly email about passing the EPPP. One high-yield topic breakdown, one study tip, and nothing else. No filler, no sales pitches, no "you've got this" without the substance to back it up.

I'm Anders — Dr. Anders Chan, Psy.D. I scored 19% on my first EPPP practice diagnostic. I spent $1K on prep programs, studied for a month, and passed on my first try with a 588.

That 19-to-588 gap taught me something: most of us don't fail because we're not smart enough. We fail because we study the wrong things in the wrong order.

This newsletter exists to fix that. Every Tuesday, I'll break down one high-yield EPPP topic and give you one practical technique to study more efficiently.

You can use these whether you use thePsychology.ai or not. The goal is for you to pass. Everything else is secondary.

Let's start with the domain most people under-study.

### HIGH-YIELD: Biological Bases of Behavior

Biological Bases of Behavior (BBB) accounts for roughly 15% of the EPPP. That makes it one of the most heavily weighted domains on the exam. But when I talk to postdocs about their study plans, it's consistently the domain they spend the least time on.

The reason is predictable: most of us came from clinical, counseling, or school psychology programs. We spent years in practicum doing therapy, not memorizing neuroanatomy. BBB feels foreign. So we gravitate toward domains that feel familiar — Treatment and Intervention, Assessment, Ethics — and hope we can pick up enough bio to get by.

That's a scoring mistake.

Here's why: improving a weak domain by 10% moves your total score more than improving a strong domain by 10%. If you're already at 70% in Treatment but 40% in BBB, the same study hour invested in BBB will move your overall score roughly twice as much.

For this week, here are the three BBB sub-topics that appear most frequently on the EPPP:

**1. Psychopharmacology — Mechanism of Action**
Know the major neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, GABA, glutamate) and which drug classes target each one. The EPPP loves questions like: "A patient on an SSRI reports improved mood after 4-6 weeks. The therapeutic delay is most likely due to..." The answer involves receptor downregulation and post-synaptic sensitivity changes, not just "serotonin goes up."

**2. Brain Structure and Function — Localization**
Know what happens when specific brain areas are damaged. Broca's area (expressive aphasia) vs. Wernicke's area (receptive aphasia). Hippocampus (encoding new memories) vs. amygdala (emotional processing, fear conditioning). The EPPP presents these as clinical vignettes: a patient presents with X symptoms after a stroke — which area is most likely affected?

**3. Neuropsychological Assessment Patterns**
Know the difference between cortical and subcortical dementia profiles. Know what a "double dissociation" means in neuropsych research. Know the basic patterns: left hemisphere damage affects language and sequential processing; right hemisphere damage affects visuospatial skills and prosody.

You don't need to become a neuropsychologist. You need to recognize patterns in vignettes. That's what the EPPP tests.

If BBB is a weak domain for you, spend your next two study sessions there before going back to your comfort domains. The score impact will be disproportionate.

### THE 5-MINUTE EDGE: The Blank Page Test

After you finish studying a topic, close your materials. Open a blank document or grab a piece of paper. Set a timer for 3 minutes.

Write down everything you can remember about what you just studied. Don't organize it. Don't make it pretty. Just dump everything from memory onto the page.

When the timer goes off, go back to your materials and check what you missed.

This is retrieval practice — the single most effective study technique identified in cognitive psychology research. It outperforms re-reading, highlighting, and summarizing. The act of pulling information from memory strengthens the neural pathways you'll need on exam day.

Three minutes. After every study session. That's it.

### FROM THE PLATFORM

This week's High-Yield topic maps directly to the Biological Bases of Behavior lessons on thePsychology.ai. If you want to go deeper on psychopharmacology or neuroanatomy, the platform has targeted lessons and adaptive quizzes for each sub-topic. Your AI coach will adjust the difficulty based on your current level. Free to try, no credit card.

### NEXT WEEK

The 3-question framework for distinguishing Piaget, Vygotsky, and Erikson on developmental psychology vignettes. (This alone is worth 4-6 questions on the exam.)

---

That's it for this week. If you found this useful, forward it to a colleague who's also studying. If you have a topic you want me to break down, reply to this email. I read every response.

## Part 3: Future Edition Topics (Content Pipeline)

1. **"Piaget vs. Vygotsky vs. Erikson: The 3-Question Framework"**
   A decision tree for developmental psychology vignettes. When the question says "zone of proximal development," it's Vygotsky. But the EPPP doesn't make it that obvious. How to distinguish overlapping concepts across theorists.

2. **"How EPPP Scoring Actually Works"**
   Most postdocs don't know that the EPPP is scaled, not raw-scored. What 500 means. Why some people "pass with a 500" and others don't. How to use this knowledge to study strategically instead of aiming for perfection.

3. **"The Ethics Questions That Aren't About Ethics"**
   The EPPP embeds ethical reasoning into clinical vignettes across every domain. A question about treatment planning might actually be testing your knowledge of informed consent. How to spot these and avoid losing points in domains you thought you knew.

4. **"Research Methods: The 20% That Covers 80% of Questions"**
   Internal vs. external validity. Type I vs. Type II errors. Threats to validity (maturation, regression to the mean, selection bias). Effect size vs. statistical significance. Most postdocs over-study obscure statistical tests and under-study these fundamentals.

5. **"One Vignette, Four Diagnoses: A Differential Diagnosis Walkthrough"**
   Walk through a realistic EPPP vignette and demonstrate the elimination process. Show how to narrow from four plausible answers to the best answer — which is how the EPPP is designed. Not "what is correct" but "what is MOST correct."

6. **"Assessment Instruments You Have to Know (and the Ones You Can Skip)"**
   MMPI-3, WAIS-IV/V, WISC-V, Rorschach (Exner system), PAI, NEO-PI-R. What the EPPP actually tests about each one: not administration details, but interpretation patterns, strengths, limitations, and when to use which.

7. **"Studying for the EPPP While Working Full-Time: A Realistic Schedule"**
   The myth of 15-20 hours/week. What 6-8 focused hours actually looks like. How to use lunch breaks, commutes, and the 20-minute gaps between clients. A week-by-week template for the postdoc who is not going to quit their job to study.

8. **"The Burnout Edition: When Studying Stops Working"**
   What cognitive fatigue actually does to retention (the research). How to recognize diminishing returns. The case for studying less during high-stress clinical weeks. Evidence-based recovery techniques that are not "take a bubble bath."

9. **"Multicultural and Diversity Considerations: What the EPPP Is Really Testing"**
   This domain has changed significantly in recent years. The EPPP isn't looking for textbook definitions of cultural competence — it's testing whether you can apply cultural considerations to clinical decision-making. Common traps and how to avoid them.

10. **"30 Days Out: What to Do in the Final Month Before Your Exam"**
    Shift from learning new material to consolidating and practicing. How to structure the last 4 weeks. When to take full-length practice exams (and when to stop). Managing pre-exam anxiety with techniques you'd use for your own clients.
