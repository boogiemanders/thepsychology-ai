# Keyword Research: thePsychology.ai

## Executive Summary

### Market Characteristics
This is a niche market with low absolute search volumes but exceptionally high intent. Someone searching "EPPP study plan" will almost certainly buy a prep program. Conversion rates for this audience are 5-10x typical content marketing.

**Content gap:** Most useful EPPP content lives on Reddit and Student Doctor Network forums. Very few well-written, authoritative blog posts exist. AATBS has blog content but it's corporate and dry. PsychPrep has minimal content. This is a massive opportunity for thePsychology.ai to own the organic search landscape for EPPP prep.

### Top 5 Opportunities

1. **"EPPP Prep Program Comparison 2026"** — Commercial intent, high value. Postdocs actively compare programs before choosing. No comprehensive, updated comparison exists. This is the #1 content piece to publish.

2. **"How to Pass the EPPP on Your First Try"** — Highest volume informational keyword. Everyone searching EPPP-related terms wants this answer. Category-defining pillar opportunity.

3. **"What to Do After Failing the EPPP"** — Underserved, emotional, high-intent. 24% fail rate = large audience. Few helpful resources exist. This is where empathy + credibility wins.

4. **"Free EPPP Study Plan"** — Lead magnet opportunity disguised as a blog post. Captures budget-conscious postdocs at the research stage. Natural bridge to platform signup.

5. **"AATBS vs PsychPrep vs thePsychology.ai"** — Comparison shopping keywords. High commercial intent. Positions the platform directly against competitors.

### Quick Wins (Rank in 1-3 months)
- "EPPP study schedule 3 month" — Low competition, specific intent
- "EPPP burnout" — No good content exists, unique differentiator
- "Is the EPPP hard" — High volume question, easy to answer well

## Content Template for Each Blog Post

Every blog post should follow this structure:

1. **SEO-optimized title** (include primary keyword)
2. **Meta description** (150-160 chars, includes keyword + compelling hook)
3. **Opening** (address the reader's pain/question directly — no "In this article...")
4. **Substance** (original insight, specific data, actionable advice)
5. **Internal links** (link to relevant platform pages: /resources, /eppp-sections, etc.)
6. **CTA** (soft: "If you're preparing for the EPPP, you can start free at thePsychology.ai" — not pushy)
7. **FAQ section** (capture "People Also Ask" queries)
8. **Author bio** (Dr. Anders Chan, Psy.D. — credibility signal)

### On-Page SEO Checklist
- [ ] Primary keyword in title (H1)
- [ ] Primary keyword in first 100 words
