      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,
      "explanation": "The meat powder was the unconditioned stimulus (US) because it naturally produced the unconditioned response of salivation in the dogs without prior learning."

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "type": "basic",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,
      "explanation": "Delay conditioning, in which the CS begins just before and overlaps the US, yields the strongest and fastest conditioning according to the reference."

      "id": "CC_004",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "type": "distinction",
      "question": "How does delay conditioning differ from trace conditioning?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Delay uses two CSs; trace uses one",
        "B": "Delay overlaps the CS and US, while trace separates them in time",

      "explanation": "Delay conditioning keeps the CS present until the US begins, whereas trace conditioning ends the CS before introducing the US, making delay generally more effective."

      "options": {
        "A": "It lacks reinforcement entirely",
        "B": "It prevents generalization",
        "C": "It removes contingency between CS and US",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": false,
      "explanation": "Backward conditioning demonstrates that classical conditioning depends on the CS predicting the US; when the US occurs before the CS, the predictive contingency is lost and conditioning fails."

      "options": {
        "A": "More pairings weaken the CR",
        "B": "More pairings strengthen the CR up to an asymptote",
        "C": "Pairings have no effect on CR strength",

      "explanation": "The magnitude of the CR increases as the CS and US are repeatedly paired, up to a point where further pairings add little."

      "question": "What is the primary difference between stimulus generalization and stimulus discrimination?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Generalization involves the US; discrimination does not",
        "B": "Generalization responds to similar stimuli, whereas discrimination learns to respond only to the original CS",
        "C": "Discrimination occurs automatically, generalization requires training",
        "D": "Discrimination eliminates the UR, generalization enhances it"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,
      "explanation": "Generalization extends the CR to stimuli resembling the CS, while discrimination training teaches the organism to respond only to the specific CS."

      "question": "How did Pavlov eliminate stimulus generalization between a 2000-Hz and 2100-Hz tone?",
      "options": {
        "A": "By pairing both tones with meat powder",
        "B": "By presenting both tones without meat powder",
        "C": "By pairing only the 2000-Hz tone with meat powder and withholding the US for 2100 Hz",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,
      "explanation": "Discrimination training repeatedly paired the original CS with the US and presented the similar tone without the US, teaching the dog to respond only to 2000 Hz."

      "id": "CC_012",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "type": "difficult",

      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": false,
      "explanation": "When animals were pushed to discriminate between almost indistinguishable stimuli, competing excitation and inhibition in the nervous system led to agitation and aggressive behavior that Pavlov called experimental neurosis."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,

      "options": {
        "A": "Inhibition weakens the CR whereas higher-order creates new CSs",
        "B": "Inhibition pairs CSs with the US, higher-order does not",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,
      "explanation": "Conditioned inhibition teaches a new cue that suppresses an existing CR, while higher-order conditioning uses the established CS as a surrogate US to generate additional CSs that elicit the CR."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,
      "explanation": "Higher-order conditioning treats the original CS as though it were a US so that a new neutral stimulus can acquire the ability to elicit the CR."

      "question": "What is the key difference between blocking and overshadowing in compound conditioning?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Blocking uses sequential CSs, overshadowing uses simultaneous CSs",
        "B": "Blocking occurs when a previously conditioned CS prevents a new CS from acquiring the CR, whereas overshadowing involves two neutral CSs where the more salient dominates",
        "C": "Blocking eliminates the US, overshadowing adds more US trials",
        "D": "Blocking strengthens both CSs equally"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": true,
      "explanation": "Blocking happens when a CS already paired with the US prevents learning about a new cue, while overshadowing starts with two neutral cues presented together and only the more salient becomes strongly conditioned."

      "question": "According to Rescorla and Wagner, why does the second neutral stimulus fail to become conditioned during blocking?",
      "options": {
        "A": "It lacks sensory capacity",
        "B": "It provides no new information about the US beyond what the first CS already predicts",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": false,
      "explanation": "Blocking occurs because the additional neutral cue does not add predictive value: the organism already expects the US when the first CS appears, so the second cue conveys no new information and never becomes a CS."

      "kn_id": "KN7",
      "is_scored": false,
      "explanation": "When two neutral cues are conditioned together, later testing reveals that the CR appears to the more salient cue alone, whereas the weaker cue fails to elicit the CR because it was overshadowed."
