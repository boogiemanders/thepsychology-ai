## Why This Material Actually Matters for Your Career

You're about to learn something that might seem dry at first (ethics codes and standards) but here's the reality: understanding these rules is what keeps your license active, your clients safe, and your career thriving. Every year, psychologists lose their licenses, face lawsuits, or damage their reputations because they didn't fully understand the APA Ethics Code. This isn't just about passing the EPPP; it's about protecting yourself and the people you'll serve throughout your entire career.

The APA Ethics Code is organized into sections that build from aspirational ideals down to enforceable rules. Think of it as having both a moral compass and a legal boundary. Today, we're focusing on the foundation: the overall structure of the Ethics Code, how to handle ethical dilemmas (Standard 1), and how to maintain competence in your work (Standard 2).

## Understanding the Framework: Guidelines vs. Standards

The APA makes an important distinction that you'll need to know for the exam:

**Guidelines** are suggestions. They recommend best practices but won't get you sanctioned if you don't follow them exactly. They're aspirational, meaning they describe the ideal way to practice.

**Standards** are mandatory rules with enforcement mechanisms. Break these, and you could face real consequences from the APA Ethics Committee, your state licensing board, or both.

There's also a difference between **practice guidelines** (how to conduct yourself in specific areas like telepsychology or forensic work) and **treatment guidelines** (which treatments work best for specific disorders like PTSD).

## Making Ethical Decisions: A Practical Framework

When you face an ethical dilemma (and you will) Fisher's ethical decision-making model gives you a roadmap:

1. **Identify the ethical problem**. What's actually wrong here?
2. **Identify relevant APA principles and standards**. What does the Ethics Code say?
3. **Identify relevant laws and regulations**. What does the law require?
4. **Consider stakeholder perspectives**. Who's affected and how?
5. **Develop and implement an action plan**. What will you actually do?
6. **Monitor and evaluate results**. Did it work? What happened?

{{M}}This is like troubleshooting when multiple apps on your phone are conflicting. You need to identify what's clashing, check the settings and permissions, consider who uses the phone, make changes, then see if the problem's resolved.{{/M}}

## The Four Sections of the Ethics Code

### Section A: Introduction and Applicability

Here's something crucial: The Ethics Code applies to your **professional activities** as a psychologist. But the APA can also take action against you for things outside your direct professional role.

Specifically, the APA Ethics Committee may act against members who have:
- Felony convictions
- Been expelled from state psychological associations
- Lost or had their licenses suspended

The key question isn't always "Was this technically part of my job?" The APA considers whether your personal actions overlap with your professional role. Here are questions to ask yourself:

- Does this personal action seem at least partially professional?
- Could this action significantly harm my clients, students, or research participants?
- Does this threaten my credibility or psychology's credibility as a profession?

{{M}}For example, if you get a DUI on your day off, that's personal. But if you're a substance abuse counselor, that personal action now threatens your professional credibility and could harm your clients' trust in treatment.{{/M}}

### Section B: The Preamble

The Preamble states the Ethics Code's primary goals: protecting the people psychologists work with and educating everyone about ethical standards. Simple, but important to remember. This code exists to protect others first, not to make your life easier.

### Section C: The Five General Principles

These are aspirational. They can't be used to sanction you, but they represent the highest ideals of the profession. They're like the philosophy behind the rules.

| Principle | Core Message | Key Points |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| A: Beneficence and Nonmaleficence | Do good and avoid harm | Strive to benefit those you work with; take care to do no harm |
| B: Fidelity and Responsibility | Build trust and give back | Establish trustworthy relationships; be aware of professional responsibilities; contribute pro bono time |
| C: Integrity | Be honest | Promote accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness in all professional activities |
| D: Justice | Ensure fairness | Everyone deserves access to psychology's benefits and equal quality services |
| E: Respect for People's Rights and Dignity | Honor differences | Respect privacy, confidentiality, self-determination, and cultural/individual differences |

Notice that Principle B mentions contributing professional time "for little or no compensation." This is aspirational. You won't be sanctioned for not doing pro bono work, but it's considered the ethical ideal.

### Section D: The Ethical Standards

These are the enforceable rules organized into ten categories. We're focusing on the first two today: Resolving Ethical Issues and Competence.

## Standard 1: Resolving Ethical Issues

### Handling Conflicts Between Ethics and Law

{{M}}Imagine your employer tells you to document therapy sessions in a way that violates confidentiality standards, or a court orders you to release information you believe should remain confidential.{{/M}} Standard 1.02 tells you what to do:

1. **Clarify the nature of the conflict**. Make sure everyone understands there's an ethical issue
2. **Make your commitment to the Ethics Code known**. Don't just silently comply
3. **Take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict**. Try to find a solution that honors ethical responsibilities

Important limitation: "Under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights."

The key word here is "reasonable." You must make a genuine effort to resolve the conflict ethically, but if reasonable actions don't work, you're permitted to comply with the legal or regulatory authority. The Ethics Code doesn't require you to go to jail or lose your job, but it does require you to try.

### Dealing with Colleagues' Ethical Violations

Standards 1.04 and 1.05 address what to do when you witness another psychologist behaving unethically.

**Standard 1.04 (Informal Resolution):** When appropriate, try to resolve the issue informally by bringing it to the colleague's attention. {{M}}Think of this like telling a coworker they're forwarding confidential emails to personal accounts before reporting them to HR.{{/M}} Give them a chance to correct the behavior first.

**Standard 1.05 (Formal Reporting):** You must report to an ethics committee, licensing board, or other authority when:
- The violation has caused or is likely to cause substantial harm
- Informal resolution isn't appropriate
- Informal resolution didn't work

**Critical caveat:** You only intervene when doing so doesn't violate confidentiality rights. However, some laws (like child abuse reporting laws) override confidentiality, and you must follow those.

Situations where informal resolution may not work:
- The colleague has an addiction issue
- The colleague has a serious mental illness affecting practice
- The colleague is generally incompetent
- Pre-existing conflict would make informal approach too confrontational

### Cooperating with Ethics Committees

Standard 1.06 requires you to cooperate with APA investigations and proceedings. Refusing to cooperate is itself an ethical violation. However, you still need to respect confidentiality, if an ethics committee asks for client information, make sure you have proper authorization before releasing it.

### Avoiding Unfair Discrimination

Standard 1.08 states you can't discriminate against someone just because they filed an ethics complaint or had one filed against them. {{M}}You can't refuse to hire someone simply because they once reported a supervisor, just like an employer can't fire you for whistleblowing.{{/M}}

However, you can take action based on the outcome of ethics proceedings or consider other appropriate information. If someone was found guilty of an ethics violation, that's fair game for employment decisions.

## Standard 2: Competence

### Staying Within Your Boundaries

Standard 2.01 is fundamental: You can only provide services, teach, and conduct research within your competence boundaries, based on your education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, or professional experience.

This isn't just about having a license. It's about specific populations and specific techniques.

**Standard 2.01(b)** addresses cultural competence: If understanding issues related to gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or other characteristics is essential for effective service, you must have the necessary knowledge and training. If you don't, make appropriate referrals.

{{M}}You wouldn't ask someone who only speaks Spanish to teach an advanced French class, even if they're an excellent language teacher. Similarly, having general therapy skills doesn't automatically qualify you to work with populations whose experiences you don't understand.{{/M}}

### Working Outside Current Competence: When It's Allowed

Life isn't always neat, and the Ethics Code recognizes this. Here are the situations where you can work outside your current competence:

| Standard | Situation | Requirements |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 2.01(c) | You want to provide services to new populations or use new techniques | Undertake relevant education, training, supervised experience, consultation, or study |
| 2.01(d) | Asked to provide services outside competence AND alternative services aren't available | Must have closely related training/experience; make reasonable effort to obtain appropriate knowledge, training, and/or consultation |
| 2.02 | Emergency situation | Alternative services unavailable; discontinue as soon as emergency ends or appropriate services available |

The practical question: Should you refer or treat? Consider:
- How big is the gap between your competence and the client's needs?
- Is an alternative provider available?
- Can you obtain adequate consultation and training quickly?

{{M}}If a client needs specialized trauma treatment and you're primarily trained in cognitive-behavioral therapy for depression, but the nearest trauma specialist is 200 miles away and your client can't travel, you might ethically treat them while getting intensive consultation and training. But if there's a qualified trauma specialist down the street, referral is the better choice.{{/M}}

### Emerging Areas and New Techniques

Standard 2.01(e) addresses situations where there's no consensus about what constitutes competence (like when telepsychology was brand new). You must still take reasonable steps to ensure competence and protect people from harm.

The APA's Guidelines for Telepsychology (2024) recommend that psychologists stay current with evolving competencies through research and literature. When providing telepsychology services without complete effectiveness information, engage clients in thorough, documented informed consent that reviews available information, risks, and benefits.

### Evidence-Based Practice

Standard 2.04 requires basing your work on "established scientific and professional knowledge." This means using evidence-based methods when they're available and applicable.

Evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP) integrates:
1. Best available research
2. Clinical expertise
3. Patient characteristics, culture, and preferences

All three components matter. Not just research alone.

### Delegating Work Appropriately

Standard 2.05 covers when you assign work to employees, supervisees, research assistants, or interpreters. You can only delegate when:

1. **No problematic multiple relationship exists**, The person doesn't have a relationship with the service recipient that could impair objectivity
2. **The person has adequate competence**. Based on education, training, and experience
3. **You ensure competent service delivery**. You supervise and monitor the work

{{M}}Don't ask your client's brother to translate during sessions, even if he speaks the language fluently. His family relationship creates a conflict that could affect both objectivity and confidentiality.{{/M}}

**Interpreter Best Practices:**
- Use certified professional interpreters when possible (National Board of Certification for Medical Interpreters)
- Obtain client consent before bringing in an interpreter
- Discuss confidentiality obligations with the interpreter
- Have written guidelines and contracts addressing confidentiality
- If subject to HIPAA, have a business associate agreement

**Vicarious Liability Warning:** You may be legally responsible for an employee's or supervisee's actions when:
- You have authority to control them
- Their conduct deviated from the standard of care and caused harm
- Their conduct was within the scope of their designated responsibilities

This means supervision isn't just about training. It's about legal liability.

### Managing Personal Problems

Standard 2.06 addresses what to do when personal issues affect your work:

1. **Don't start new professional activities** when personal problems will likely impede effectiveness
2. **Take appropriate measures** when you become aware personal problems might negatively affect ongoing work

Appropriate measures might include:
- Seeking consultation
- Limiting professional activities
- Suspending activities temporarily
- Terminating activities

{{M}}If you're going through a devastating divorce and realize you're zoning out during sessions, getting irritable with clients, or missing important clinical details, you need to act. Maybe that means reducing your caseload, taking a brief leave, or getting your own therapy. But you can't just push through while providing substandard care.{{/M}}

The standard requires self-awareness and honesty. Most personal problems don't require stopping work entirely, but they do require acknowledgment and action.

## Common Misconceptions Students Get Wrong

**Misconception 1:** "The General Principles can be used to file ethics complaints."
- **Reality:** General Principles are aspirational only. You can't be sanctioned based on them alone. Only the Ethical Standards are enforceable.

**Misconception 2:** "If a law requires me to do something unethical, I must refuse."
- **Reality:** You must make reasonable efforts to resolve the conflict, but if those efforts fail, you can comply with the law (unless it violates human rights).

**Misconception 3:** "I must always try informal resolution before reporting a colleague's ethics violation."
- **Reality:** Informal resolution is only required when appropriate. Some situations (addiction, serious harm, general incompetence) may warrant going straight to formal reporting.

**Misconception 4:** "Once I'm licensed, I'm competent to treat anyone with any problem."
- **Reality:** Competence is specific to populations, techniques, and contexts. Your license is permission to practice, but you're ethically bound to only work within your actual areas of competence.

**Misconception 5:** "Evidence-based practice means I must always use manualized treatments."
- **Reality:** EBPP integrates best research with clinical expertise and patient characteristics. Sometimes the evidence supports flexibility and adaptation.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For the Five General Principles, remember "BF-ICE":**
- **B**eneficence and Nonmaleficence (do good, avoid harm)
- **F**idelity and Responsibility (be trustworthy, give back)
- **I**ntegrity (be honest)
- **C**ulture and Justice (ensure fairness. Okay, this is adapted, but it helps!)
- **E**veryone's Rights and Dignity (respect differences)

**For competence boundaries, use the "ETS" rule:**
- **E**ducation
- **T**raining
- **S**upervised experience
(Plus consultation, study, and professional experience)

**For deciding whether to refer or treat with consultation:**
- Big gap + available alternative = **Refer**
- Small gap OR no alternative + you get training/consultation = **May treat**
- Emergency + no alternative = **Treat, but stop when emergency ends**

**For colleague violations, remember the "SH-3" rule:**
- **S**ubstantial harm caused/likely
- **H**ard to resolve informally
- Try informal first (when appropriate), then go formal if needed

## Key Takeaways

- **Guidelines are suggestions; standards are mandatory rules** with enforcement mechanisms

- **The Ethics Code has four sections:** Introduction and Applicability, Preamble, General Principles (aspirational), and Ethical Standards (enforceable)

- **Personal actions can lead to APA sanctions** if they overlap with your professional role or involve felony convictions, even if they occur outside work

- **When ethics and law conflict:** Clarify, make your ethical commitment known, and take reasonable steps to resolve. But you can comply with law if reasonable efforts fail (except when it violates human rights)

- **Colleague violations:** Try informal resolution when appropriate; report formally when substantial harm occurred/likely, informal won't work, or informal failed

- **Competence is specific** to populations, techniques, and contexts. Not just having a license

- **You can work outside current competence in limited situations:** emergencies, when no alternatives exist (with consultation/training), or when expanding your practice with proper preparation

- **Delegating work requires:** no problematic multiple relationships, adequate competence of the person you're delegating to, and your ongoing supervision

- **Personal problems affecting work require action:** don't start new activities when impaired, and take appropriate measures (consultation, limiting, suspending, or terminating activities) when problems arise

- **Evidence-based practice** integrates research, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics. It's not just following treatment manuals

Understanding these foundations will help you navigate the complex ethical situations you'll face throughout your career. The key is knowing that ethics isn't about perfection. It's about making thoughtful, informed decisions that prioritize the welfare of the people you serve while protecting yourself and the profession.
