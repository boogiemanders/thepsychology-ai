## Understanding Bipolar and Depressive Disorders: Your EPPP Guide

When you're scrolling through social media late at night, you might see a post from someone saying, "I'm so bipolar today (happy one minute, sad the next!" But here's the thing: what we're about to study is vastly different from everyday mood swings. Bipolar and depressive disorders are serious mental health conditions that affect millions of people, and as a future psychologist, you'll need to diagnose them accurately, understand their origins, and know how to treat them effectively. This isn't just exam material) it's knowledge that could literally save someone's life.

Let's dive into what makes these disorders tick and how to spot the differences between them.

## The Three Building Blocks: Understanding Mood Episodes

Before we can diagnose any bipolar or depressive disorder, we need to understand three fundamental mood episodes. {{M}}Think of these as the basic ingredients in different recipes{{/M}}, the same ingredients combined in different ways create entirely different dishes.

### Manic Episode: The Accelerator Stuck Down

A **manic episode** involves an abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood plus increased energy lasting at least one week. But it's not just feeling really good after landing a promotion. We're talking about three or more of these symptoms:

- Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
- Decreased need for sleep (not just insomnia. They genuinely don't feel tired)
- More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking
- Flight of ideas or racing thoughts
- Distractibility
- Increased goal-directed activity or physical restlessness
- Excessive involvement in risky activities

The key here: these symptoms cause **marked impairment** in functioning, require hospitalization, or include psychotic features. This is serious stuff.

### Hypomanic Episode: The Milder Version

A **hypomanic episode** looks similar but less intense. Same elevated or irritable mood, same symptoms, but only needs to last four consecutive days. The crucial difference? No severe impairment, no hospitalization needed, and no psychotic features. {{M}}If mania is driving 100 mph on the highway, hypomania is going 75 in a 55 zone{{/M}}. Still not normal, but you're less likely to crash.

### Major Depressive Episode: When Everything Goes Dark

A **major depressive episode** requires five or more symptoms lasting at least two weeks, with at least one being either depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure. These symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in functioning.

## The Bipolar Disorders: Different Combinations, Different Diagnoses

Now let's combine those episodes into actual diagnoses:

| Disorder | Required Episodes | Minimum Duration | Key Features |
|----------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Bipolar I** | At least one manic episode | One week (for mania) | May or may not have depressive episodes; most severe form |
| **Bipolar II** | At least one hypomanic AND one major depressive episode | 4 days (hypomania) + 2 weeks (depression) | Never had full manic episode; depression is primary problem |
| **Cyclothymic Disorder** | Multiple periods of hypomanic symptoms + depressive symptoms | 2 years (adults) or 1 year (children/adolescents) | Symptoms don't meet full criteria for episodes; chronic but less severe |

Here's what trips people up: Bipolar I only requires ONE manic episode. That person might never have depression, but they still have Bipolar I. Bipolar II, however, requires both hypomania AND depression, the depressive episodes are actually the more problematic feature for most people with this diagnosis.

## Where Do Bipolar Disorders Come From?

### The Genetics Are Strong

Bipolar disorder runs in families. Heavily. Heritability estimates range from 60% to 90%, which is huge. {{M}}If your genes were a playlist determining your mental health, bipolar disorder would be one of the songs with the volume turned way up{{/M}}. 

The concordance rates tell the story:
- Monozygotic (identical) twins: 40-80%
- Dizygotic (fraternal) twins: 5-30%

Some research suggests that female twins show higher concordance rates than male twins, and Bipolar I appears more heritable than Bipolar II.

### Environmental Triggers Matter Too

But genes aren't destiny. Environmental risk factors include:
- Early parental loss or childhood maltreatment (especially emotional abuse)
- Medical conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, or migraines
- Substance use (cannabis, cocaine, and others)
- Highly stressful life events

## The Tricky Diagnosis: Bipolar vs. ADHD

This is an EPPP favorite because it's genuinely challenging in clinical practice. Both disorders share distractibility, irritability, and accelerated speech. So how do you tell them apart?

**For children and adolescents**, look for mania-specific symptoms that don't overlap with ADHD:
- Elation
- Grandiosity
- Flight of ideas/racing thoughts
- Decreased need for sleep (without feeling tired)
- Hypersexuality (age-inappropriate sexual behavior or preoccupation)

**For adults**, here's your comparison chart:

| Feature | Manic Episode | ADHD |
|---------|---------------|------|
| Mood | Euphoric, elevated, or irritable | Labile, dysphoric |
| Self-esteem | Increased or grandiose | Reduced |
| Distractibility | Caused by thought acceleration | Caused by wandering thoughts |
| Sleep | Decreased need without discomfort | Fatigue and discomfort after sleep loss |
| Sexual activity | Increased during episodes | Not increased; more risky behaviors and sexual disorders |

## Treating Bipolar Disorder: A Combination Approach

Treatment typically involves psychotherapy plus medication. The evidence-based psychosocial interventions include:

- Psychoeducation
- Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy
- Cognitive-behavior therapy
- Family-focused therapy (addresses high expressed emotion in families)

### The Medication Picture

Here's where it gets interesting. The field distinguishes between "classic" and "atypical" presentations:

**Classic bipolar disorder** (best treated with lithium):
- Low likelihood of mixed mood states and rapid cycling
- Long recovery periods between episodes
- Onset between 15-19 years

**Atypical bipolar disorder** (best treated with anticonvulsants or second-generation antipsychotics):
- Mixed mood states and rapid cycling
- Incomplete recovery between episodes
- Onset between 10-15 years

Note: This classic/atypical distinction isn't official DSM-5-TR terminology, but it's clinically useful.

## The Depressive Disorders: When Sadness Becomes Clinical

Now let's shift gears to depression. The main players are:

### Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

Requires five or more depressive symptoms for at least two weeks, with at least one being depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure. The symptoms must cause significant distress or functional impairment.

### Persistent Depressive Disorder

A depressed mood plus two or more symptoms lasting at least two years (adults) or one year (children/adolescents). {{M}}Think of this as the marathon version of depression{{/M}}. It's chronic and long-lasting, though often less severe than MDD at any given moment.

### Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder

This one's for kids and involves:
- Severe, recurrent temper outbursts (verbal or behavioral) that are way out of proportion, occurring three or more times weekly
- Persistent irritable or angry mood between outbursts, observable most of the day, nearly every day
- Must be present for at least 12 months

Important note: If someone meets criteria for both MDD and persistent depressive disorder, you assign BOTH diagnoses.

## Special Circumstances in Depression

### Peripartum Depression

The "with peripartum onset" specifier applies when symptoms begin during pregnancy or within four weeks after delivery. Here are the facts:

- Up to 80% of women experience "baby blues" (sadness, irritability, anxiety)
- A smaller percentage develop full MDD
- Of those with MDD, about 50% had symptoms before delivery

Effective treatments include CBT, interpersonal therapy, and antidepressants (especially sertraline). However, {{M}}prescribing medication becomes a balancing act{{/M}}, weighing potential effects on the fetus or nursing infant against the risks of untreated maternal depression.

Exercise helps too, with research showing that exercise combined with other interventions is more effective than those interventions alone.

### Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

The "with seasonal pattern" specifier typically applies to winter-onset depression. Symptoms include hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and carbohydrate cravings. It's linked to low serotonin and high melatonin levels. Treatment often involves phototherapy (bright light exposure) which suppresses melatonin production.

### The Gender Gap

During childhood, depression rates are similar for boys and girls. But in early adolescence, rates for females skyrocket while male rates stay stable. Why? Hormonal changes at puberty may sensitize females but desensitize males to stress from negative life events. This pattern continues into adulthood, with females having rates 1.5 to 3 times higher than males.

## What Causes Major Depressive Disorder?

### Genetic Factors

MDD is heritable, but less so than bipolar disorder:
- Heritability estimates: 30-50%
- Concordance rates: 46% (monozygotic twins), 20% (dizygotic twins)
- The personality trait of neuroticism explains much of the genetic contribution

### Brain Chemistry and Structure

Low levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine are associated with depression. But there's more:

**HPA Axis Abnormalities**: Chronic stress (especially early in life) leads to persistent hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and elevated cortisol. {{M}}It's like your stress alarm system gets stuck in the "on" position{{/M}}.

**Brain Structure Changes**: Depression is linked to abnormalities in multiple brain regions. Particularly important for the EPPP:
- **Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)**: Abnormally HIGH activity during depression
- **Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)**: Abnormally LOW activity during depression
- When treatment works (therapy or medication), this pattern reverses

### Behavioral and Cognitive Theories

Three major theories you need to know:

**Lewinsohn's Social Reinforcement Theory**: Depression results from low rates of positive reinforcement for social behaviors. This could be due to lack of environmental reinforcement or poor social skills. {{M}}The person becomes isolated, which leads to more depression, which leads to more isolation, a downward spiral{{/M}}.

**Seligman's Learned Helplessness Model**: Started with the idea that repeated exposure to uncontrollable negative events creates helplessness. The reformulated version added cognitive style. Specifically, attributing negative events to stable, internal, and global factors. The latest version (hopelessness theory) says hopelessness is the direct cause of depression, resulting from negative events plus negative cognitive style.

**Beck's Cognitive Theory**: Depression stems from a negative cognitive triad:
1. Negative thoughts about oneself
2. Negative thoughts about the world
3. Negative thoughts about the future

## Age and Cultural Considerations

### Risk Factors Vary by Age

**Younger adults**: Risk linked to genetics, stressful life events, and cognitive limitations

**Older adults**: Chronic medical illness is one of the strongest risk factors, especially when it limits physical functioning and creates social isolation

### Expression of Depression Varies Too

**Older adults** are less likely to report emotional symptoms and more likely to report:
- Physical complaints
- Cognitive changes
- Loss of interest in activities

**Cultural differences**: Members of Latino, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Asian cultures often report more somatic symptoms (headaches, heart palpitations, appetite/sleep changes), while Western cultures emphasize psychological symptoms (depressed mood, loneliness, hopelessness).

## The Comorbidity Picture

MDD rarely travels alone. Among U.S. adults with MDD:
1. Substance use disorders are most common (especially alcohol use disorder)
2. Anxiety disorders come next
3. Personality disorders follow

### Sleep Abnormalities

Depression disrupts sleep architecture:
- Longer time to fall asleep
- Shorter time from sleep onset to REM sleep
- Less slow-wave (deep) sleep
- Increased REM density (more rapid eye movements)

### Medical Comorbidities

Depression is bidirectionally related to several medical conditions. For example, depression increases risk for heart attacks, AND heart attacks increase risk for developing depression and anxiety (with depression being more common).

## Treating Major Depressive Disorder

### The Big Picture: Combination Treatment Wins

A major meta-analysis found that combining psychotherapy and medication produces better response and remission rates than either treatment alone, with no significant difference between psychotherapy alone and medication alone.

For comorbid MDD and substance use disorder, use a concurrent approach addressing both simultaneously.

### Age-Specific Treatment Recommendations (APA Guidelines)

| Age Group | Recommended Treatments |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Children** | Insufficient evidence for specific recommendations |
| **Adolescents** | CBT or IPT-A; fluoxetine (no clear preference between therapy and medication) |
| **Adults** | CBT, MBCT, IPT, behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, or supportive therapy; SSRIs or SNRIs (no hierarchy among options) |
| **Older Adults (60+)** | Group CBT OR combined IPT + second-generation antidepressant |

For adults with chronic or treatment-resistant depression, combining CBT or IPT with medication is typically appropriate.

### Alternative and Adjunctive Treatments

**St. John's Wort**: Effective for mild-to-moderate depression with fewer side effects than SSRIs. But watch out. It doesn't work for severe depression and interacts dangerously with SSRIs (causing serotonin syndrome) and reduces effectiveness of some other medications.

**Ketamine (Esketamine nasal spray)**: Fast-acting for treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation. Works by increasing glutamate. Must be self-administered under supervision in a healthcare setting due to potential side effects.

**Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)**: The heavy hitter for severe depression. 

Response rates: ~80%
Remission rates: ~70%
Time to remission: 1-3 weeks

Compare this to psychotherapy (response: 30-60%, remission: 25-45%, time: 6-10 weeks) or medication (remission: 4-12 weeks).

The downside? Memory loss. ECT causes both anterograde amnesia (difficulty forming new memories) and retrograde amnesia (difficulty recalling past events). Anterograde amnesia usually resolves within weeks. Retrograde amnesia improves over weeks to months, but many patients have persistent memory gaps for pre-ECT events. Bilateral electrode placement and more frequent sessions cause worse amnesia.

**Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)**: Noninvasive magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Lower response and remission rates than ECT, but no sedation required and no memory loss.

**Telepsychology**: Research shows comparable outcomes to face-to-face therapy for depression in terms of symptom severity, quality of life, satisfaction, and therapeutic alliance.

**Physical Activity and Exercise**: Reduces depressive symptoms even at levels below public health recommendations. Can have comparable effects to therapy or medication for mild-to-moderate depression. Adding exercise to therapy or medication improves their effectiveness. Benefits may work through improved cognitive functioning (memory, executive function, reward processing).

## Suicide: The Critical Risk Factor

You need to know these demographics for the EPPP:

### Key Statistics (2022 CDC Data)

- Males: 4 times higher suicide rate than females
- Highest rate for males: ages 75+
- Highest rate for females: ages 45-64
- Ethnicity: Highest rates for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native individuals

### Special Populations

**Veterans**: Suicide rate of 34.7 per 100,000 vs. 17.1 for non-veterans

**Previously Incarcerated**: Higher rates than currently incarcerated, and interestingly, women's rates increase dramatically after release, reaching levels similar to men (while in the general population, men's rates are much higher than women's).

**Transgender Individuals**: Much higher rates of suicidality than cisgender individuals. One study found lifetime rates of suicidal ideation at 81% for transgender adults vs. 35% for cisgender adults, and suicide attempts at 42% vs. 11%.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception #1**: "Bipolar disorder means rapid mood swings throughout the day."
Reality: Episodes last days to weeks. Mood changes within a single day are not diagnostic.

**Misconception #2**: "If someone has a manic episode followed by depression, it's always Bipolar I."
Reality: Bipolar I only requires one manic episode. Depression may or may not be present.

**Misconception #3**: "Hypomanic episodes aren't serious because they don't cause marked impairment."
Reality: They're still clinically significant and, in Bipolar II, often precede severe depressive episodes.

**Misconception #4**: "The high energy in ADHD and mania is the same thing."
Reality: Look at the quality of distractibility, sleep needs, and mood type to differentiate.

**Misconception #5**: "ECT is barbaric and outdated."
Reality: Modern ECT is safe and highly effective for severe depression, with the highest response and remission rates of any treatment.

## Memory Strategies for the EPPM

**For distinguishing bipolar disorders**, remember the numbers:
- Bipolar I = **1** manic episode (that's all you need)
- Bipolar II = **2** types of episodes required (hypomania + depression)

**For episode duration**, think escalating:
- Hypomania: **4** days
- Mania: **7** days (one week)
- Major depression: **14** days (two weeks)
- Cyclothymic: **2** years (adults)

**For brain activity in depression**, think "DL goes Down, VM goes uP":
- **D**orso**L**ateral prefrontal cortex: **Down** (decreased activity)
- **V**entro**M**edial prefrontal cortex: u**P** (increased activity)

**For suicide rates**, remember "males complete, females attempt". Males have higher completion rates, females have higher attempt rates (though this pattern reverses in previously incarcerated populations).

## Key Takeaways for the EPPP

- **Three mood episodes form the foundation**: manic (≥7 days, marked impairment), hypomanic (≥4 days, no marked impairment), major depressive (≥14 days, significant distress/impairment)

- **Bipolar I needs only ONE manic episode**; Bipolar II requires BOTH hypomania AND depression

- **Bipolar disorder is highly heritable** (60-90%) with concordance rates of 40-80% for identical twins

- **Differentiating bipolar from ADHD**: Look for elation, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep without fatigue, and hypersexuality in bipolar

- **MDD is less heritable than bipolar** (30-50%) but still has significant genetic contribution

- **Brain changes in depression**: High vmPFC activity and low dlPFC activity (reverses with successful treatment)

- **Three cognitive/behavioral theories**: Lewinsohn (low reinforcement), Seligman (learned helplessness/hopelessness), Beck (negative cognitive triad)

- **Treatment for adults with MDD**: Psychotherapy (CBT, IPT, MBCT, behavioral, psychodynamic, supportive) or second-generation antidepressants, with no preference between options for initial treatment

- **Combination therapy works best** for MDD overall, especially for chronic or treatment-resistant cases

- **ECT has the highest response and remission rates** (~80% and ~70%) but causes memory impairment

- **Suicide demographics**: Males 4x higher rate, highest for males 75+, females 45-64, American Indian/Alaskan Native individuals have highest ethnic rates

You've got this. These disorders are complex, but understanding the building blocks (those three mood episodes) gives you the foundation for everything else. Keep reviewing the distinctions, practice applying the criteria, and you'll be well-prepared for whatever the EPPP throws at you.
