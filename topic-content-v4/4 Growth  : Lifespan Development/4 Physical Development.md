## Why Physical Development Matters for Your EPPP Success

Physical development isn't just about babies learning to walk or teenagers hitting growth spurts. Understanding how the body and brain develop across the lifespan gives you crucial insight into when certain psychological disorders might emerge, why certain interventions work better at different ages, and how biological changes influence behavior and cognition. You'll face questions about this on the EPPP, and more importantly, you'll use this knowledge throughout your entire career as a psychologist.

Let's break down what you need to know, making it clear and memorable.

## The Brain's Journey: From Birth Through Adulthood

### Early Brain Development: The First Two Years

When a baby is born, their brain weighs about 25% of what it will weigh as an adult. But here's what's remarkable: by age two, it's already at 80% of adult weight. That's explosive growth in just 24 months.

What drives this growth? It's not actually new neurons being created. Most neurons are already present at birth. Instead, three major processes are happening:

**Synaptogenesis** is the creation of new synapses (connections between neurons). {{M}}Think of it like building a massive social network where each neuron is constantly making new connections with other neurons.{{/M}} This process peaks between ages two and three.

**Dendritic growth** involves neurons growing more branches (dendrites) to receive signals from other neurons. More branches mean more potential connections and more complex information processing.

**Myelination** is when axons get covered in myelin, a fatty substance that acts as insulation. This speeds up nerve impulse transmission dramatically. {{M}}If you've ever wondered why your internet runs faster with a better cable connection, myelin works similarly for your nervous system{{/M}}. It makes signals travel faster and more efficiently.

### Synaptic Pruning: Use It or Lose It

After this explosive growth in synapses, something counterintuitive happens: the brain starts cutting connections. This process is called **synaptic pruning**, and it continues through adolescence.

Here's the logic: synapses that get used frequently become stronger and more efficient. Those that don't get used? They fade away. {{M}}It's like when you first move to a new city and explore lots of different routes to work, but eventually you stick with the two or three that work best and forget about all the others.{{/M}} This isn't a loss. It's optimization. The brain is becoming more specialized and efficient.

### The Prefrontal Cortex: The Last to Mature

The cerebral cortex is the least developed brain area at birth. Within the cortex, the **prefrontal cortex** (responsible for executive functions like planning, impulse control, and decision-making) doesn't reach full maturity until the late teens to mid-20s.

This has massive implications for understanding adolescent behavior. When teenagers make impulsive decisions or seem unable to fully think through consequences, it's not just rebellion. Their prefrontal cortex literally isn't finished developing yet. This matters for the EPPP because you need to understand why certain interventions work better at different ages and why some disorders emerge when they do.

### Adult Brain Changes: The Long Decline

Brain weight and volume start gradually decreasing around age 30 due to neuron loss. This process accelerates after age 60. The frontal lobes (especially that prefrontal cortex) and parietal lobes show the greatest decrease in size.

But here's the good news: the brain isn't helpless against this decline. It compensates through:

- **Developing new connections** between remaining neurons
- **Neurogenesis** (producing new neurons) in the hippocampus and possibly other areas

This explains why many older adults maintain strong cognitive abilities despite some neuron loss, the brain adapts.

## Sensory Development: How We Experience the World

### Vision: From Blur to Clarity

Vision is the least developed sense at birth. A newborn's visual acuity is roughly 20/400 to 20/600. What they see at 20 feet, adults with normal vision see clearly at 400-600 feet. By 7-8 months, though, infants have visual acuity similar to normal adults.

Despite limited vision, newborns show fascinating preferences:
- They prefer patterned stimuli over plain ones
- They prefer faces over non-facial images
- By 1-2 months, they prefer their mother's face over strangers' faces

**Depth Perception** develops in three stages:

| Age | Depth Cue Type | Description |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 3-4 weeks | Kinetic cues | Based on object movement |
| 2-3 months | Binocular cues | From integrating images from both eyes |
| 5-6 months | Pictorial cues | Can perceive depth with one eye using size, shadows, texture |

### Vision in Adulthood: Presbyopia and Beyond

Around age 40, many adults develop **presbyopia**. Difficulty focusing on nearby objects due to hardening of the eye's lens. {{M}}You know how some people start holding their phone at arm's length to read texts?{{/M}} That's presbyopia in action.

Other age-related vision changes include:
- Decreased sensitivity to low light
- Slower adjustment when moving from light to dark spaces
- Increased sensitivity to glare
- Reduced color discrimination
- Decreased depth perception

### Hearing: Development and Decline

Newborns are somewhat less sensitive to sound than adults, especially high-frequency sounds. But sensitivity develops quickly, approaching adult levels by six months.

Within days after birth, infants prefer their mother's voice over other sounds. They also show **auditory localization**. Reflexively turning toward sound sources. Interestingly, this ability temporarily decreases between 2-4 months before re-emerging more deliberately and precisely, reaching near-adult levels by 12 months.

**Presbycusis** (age-related hearing loss) typically starts around age 40, beginning with decreased sensitivity to high-frequency sounds. This makes certain sounds harder to hear:
- Women's and children's voices
- Fricative consonants (f, s, t). Softer and higher-pitched
- Non-human sounds (microwave beeps, dryer buzzers, bird chirping)

Background noise makes presbycusis effects worse. Here's something critical for the EPPP: research shows that severity of age-related hearing loss correlates with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and other neurocognitive disorders. This connection between sensory loss and cognitive decline is important for understanding older adult populations.

### Touch and Pain: Our Earliest Sense

Touch develops first in utero, and newborns have well-developed touch sensitivity at birth. They respond to a cheek touch by turning their head toward the touch. That's the rooting reflex.

Newborns are also sensitive to pain. Research shows that male infants who received circumcision without anesthetic at three days old cried intensely during the procedure. More importantly, early pain exposure affects future pain responses. Infants circumcised without topical anesthetic responded more intensely to routine vaccinations 4-6 months later compared to those who received anesthetic.

There's a fascinating twist: this effect differs for full-term versus preterm infants. Early pain exposure heightens later pain responsivity for full-term infants but dampens it for preterm infants. This suggests different neural mechanisms for pain processing depending on developmental stage.

## Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): What You Need to Know

SIDS is the unexpected death of an infant under one year (usually during sleep) that remains unexplained after thorough investigation. Peak risk is 2-4 months of age.

While the exact cause remains unclear, evidence points to serotonin abnormalities in the medulla (part of the brainstem regulating breathing and vital functions).

**Risk factors include:**
- Male gender
- African American or Native American race
- Age 6 months or younger
- Premature birth or low birth weight
- Poor prenatal care
- Maternal substance use during pregnancy
- Pre- and postnatal smoke exposure
- Unsafe sleep practices (bed-sharing, soft bedding, stomach sleeping)

**Protective factors include:**
- Back sleeping position
- Breastfeeding
- Bare crib (minimal bedding)
- Avoiding overheating
- Room-sharing without bed-sharing
- Offering pacifier (without strap) at sleep times

## Gross Motor Development: The Predictable Sequence

Motor development follows a consistent sequence, though exact timing varies between children. Here are the key milestones you should know for the EPPP:

| Age Range | Key Milestones |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1-3 months | Lifts chin then chest in prone position, rolls to side |
| 4-6 months | Sits with support, rolls front-to-back and back-to-front |
| 7-9 months | Sits without support, begins creeping, pulls to stand |
| 10-12 months | Creeps well, cruises furniture, takes independent steps |
| 13-15 months | Stands without pulling up, walks well, climbs stairs |
| 16-18 months | Walks backward, runs well, throws ball while standing |
| 19-30 months | Walks up/down stairs with assistance, kicks ball, jumps |
| 31-36 months | Balances on one foot (3 seconds), pedals tricycle, catches ball |
| 4 years | Hops on one foot, balances 4-8 seconds, throws overhand 10 feet |
| 5 years | Hops 15 times, balances 8+ seconds, walks backward heel-toe |

The sequence matters more than exact timing. A child who skips crawling but walks on time isn't necessarily delayed, but one who shows no progress toward the next milestone might need evaluation.

## Adolescent Physical Development: More Than Just Growth

### The Growth Spurt

The adolescent growth spurt (rapid height and weight increase) marks adolescence's beginning. It typically starts at:
- Girls: 10-11 years
- Boys: 12-13 years

The spurt peaks about two years after starting and lasts 3-4 years total.

### Puberty Timing: Different Outcomes for Boys and Girls

**Early Puberty in Boys**. Mixed bag:

Positive effects:
- Higher self-esteem
- Greater social maturity
- More popularity
- Better athletic skills

Negative effects:
- Higher alcohol use
- More antisocial behavior
- Precocious sexual behavior

**Late Puberty in Boys:**
- Lower self-esteem and popularity
- Poorer academic performance
- Higher anxiety and depression

**Early Puberty in Girls**. Predominantly negative:
- Lower self-esteem and popularity
- Poorer academic achievement
- Higher risk for precocious sexual behavior
- Increased rates of substance use, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and disruptive behavior

Predictors of early puberty in girls include maternal mood disorder, biological father's absence, stepfather or maternal boyfriend presence, and discordant family relationships.

Research on late puberty in girls is limited with mixed results.

### The Adolescent Brain: Why Teenagers Take Risks

Remember how the prefrontal cortex doesn't mature until the late teens to mid-20s? Here's where that matters most: the limbic system (involved in emotions and motivation) develops earlier than the prefrontal cortex.

The **nucleus accumbens** (part of the brain's reward circuit) is in the limbic system and becomes highly active during adolescence. Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex (handling planning, decision-making, impulse control) is still under construction.

{{M}}Imagine having a car with a powerful accelerator but brakes that haven't been fully installed yet.{{/M}} Adolescents make decisions based more on emotions and pleasure-seeking than rational thinking because the brain regions responsible for those different processes develop at different rates. This explains increased substance use and other risk-taking behaviors.

Critical point for the EPPP: individuals who begin using addictive drugs in early adolescence face greater risk for substance use disorders than those who delay use until late adolescence or early adulthood, precisely because these drugs affect the developing brain differently.

## Adolescent Substance Use: Risk and Protection

According to 2024 data from youth ages 12-17:
- 6.6% reported past-month alcohol use
- 6.0% reported nicotine vaping
- 6.0% reported marijuana use
- 1.9% reported tobacco product use

**Risk Factors:**
- Stressful life events
- Parental substance abuse
- Weak parent-child relationships
- Affiliation with substance-using peers
- Mental health problems (especially depression and untreated ADHD)
- Favorable attitudes toward drug use
- Poor social skills
- Academic failures

**Protective Factors:**
- Parental disapproval of substance use
- Supportive parenting
- Age-appropriate parental monitoring
- Academic success
- Extracurricular involvement
- Positive peer influences
- Good self-control
- Religiosity

Some protective factors have a **buffering effect**. They reduce adverse effects of stressful life events on substance use. Research shows this buffering effect for religiosity, self-control, and parental support.

## Adolescent Sleep Deprivation: A Perfect Storm

Chronic sleep deprivation is common during adolescence and causes:
- Increased risk for depression, anxiety, substance use
- Impaired concentration, memory, information processing
- More headaches, stomachaches, and physical symptoms

Carskadon describes adolescent sleep deprivation as a "perfect storm" created by:

**Biological factors:** Delayed sleep onset during puberty due to changes in melatonin secretion

**Societal factors:** Early school start times limiting available sleep time

**Psychosocial factors:** Greater autonomy over bedtimes, increased academic pressure, excessive screen time

Screen time particularly exacerbates delayed sleep onset by suppressing melatonin production. This combination creates a situation where teenagers biologically want to stay up later, but society forces them to wake up early, resulting in chronic sleep debt.

## Sexual Orientation and Fluidity

### Biological Contributions to Sexual Orientation

Contemporary research focuses on biological factors:

**Genetics:** Monozygotic twins are more likely than dizygotic twins to share sexual orientation, with stronger effects for males than females.

**Fraternal Birth Order Effect:** Each older brother born to the same mother increases the likelihood a boy will be gay. The maternal immune hypothesis proposes this reflects progressive maternal immunization to male-specific antigens with each successive male fetus, affecting sexual differentiation in the brain. However, these findings have faced methodological challenges.

### Sexual Fluidity

**Sexual fluidity** refers to changes in sexual attractions and/or behaviors over time and in different situations that are inconsistent with self-described sexual orientation. It occurs in both men and women but is somewhat more common in women.

Important distinction: Sexual fluidity ≠ Bisexuality

Sexual fluidity is transient and situation-dependent, while bisexuality involves stable, persistent attraction to both men and women.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception 1:** "The brain stops developing in childhood."

Actually, the prefrontal cortex continues developing into the mid-20s. This has huge implications for understanding adolescent and young adult behavior.

**Misconception 2:** "Brain decline in aging is just about losing neurons."

The brain compensates through neurogenesis and forming new connections. Cognitive decline isn't inevitable or uniform.

**Misconception 3:** "Early puberty affects boys and girls similarly."

The outcomes are quite different. Early puberty tends to have mixed or positive effects for boys but predominantly negative effects for girls.

**Misconception 4:** "SIDS is caused by suffocation."

SIDS remains unexplained after investigation, though serotonin abnormalities in the medulla are implicated. Many SIDS cases occur even without obvious suffocation risks.

**Misconception 5:** "Sexual orientation is purely environmental."

Strong evidence supports biological contributions, particularly genetic factors and prenatal influences.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For brain development:** Create a timeline visual with age markers (birth, 2 years, adolescence, 20s, 30, 60) and note what's happening at each point.

**For sensory development:** Remember the acronym "VHL". Vision Lags, Hearing develops, touch is there from the start (L for Lags, not present).

**For depth perception sequence:** "Kids Before Preschool". Kinetic (3-4 weeks), Binocular (2-3 months), Pictorial (5-6 months).

**For puberty timing effects:** Girls = Generally negative for early; Boys = Both positive and negative for early.

**For adolescent substance use:** Think "Risk vs. Shield". List risk factors on one side, protective factors on the other. Remember that self-control, religiosity, and parental support have buffering effects.

**For motor milestones:** Don't memorize exact ages. Focus on sequence: head control → rolling → sitting → crawling → standing → walking → running → jumping/hopping. This progression makes logical sense.

## Key Takeaways

- **Brain development is rapid in the first two years** (25% to 80% of adult weight) due to synaptogenesis, dendritic growth, and myelination. Not new neurons.

- **Synaptic pruning continues through adolescence**, strengthening used connections and eliminating unused ones for efficiency.

- **Prefrontal cortex doesn't mature until late teens to mid-20s**, explaining adolescent impulsivity and risk-taking when combined with earlier limbic system development.

- **Brain volume decreases starting around age 30**, accelerating after 60, but neurogenesis and new connections provide compensation.

- **Vision is least developed at birth** but reaches adult levels by 7-8 months; presbyopia begins around age 40.

- **Hearing and vision are first senses to decline** in adulthood, both starting around age 40; presbycusis (high-frequency hearing loss) correlates with increased dementia risk.

- **Touch develops first in utero**; early pain exposure affects future pain responses differently for full-term versus preterm infants.

- **SIDS peaks at 2-4 months**; back sleeping and avoiding bed-sharing are key protective factors.

- **Motor development follows consistent sequence** though timing varies; sequence matters more than exact ages.

- **Early puberty has different effects** by gender: mixed for boys, predominantly negative for girls; predictors for girls include family factors.

- **Adolescent risk-taking results from limbic system/prefrontal cortex developmental mismatch**; early substance use increases addiction risk due to effects on developing brain.

- **Adolescent sleep deprivation stems from biological, societal, and psychosocial factors** combining into a "perfect storm"; screen time exacerbates the problem.

- **Sexual orientation has strong biological contributions** including genetics and prenatal factors; sexual fluidity differs from bisexuality and is more common in women.

You've got this. Physical development questions on the EPPP test your understanding of how biological changes influence psychological functioning across the lifespan. Focus on the connections between physical changes and behavior, remember key age markers, and understand why timing matters for outcomes.
