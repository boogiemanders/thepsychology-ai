## Why Choosing Employees Matters More Than You Think

When you accept a job offer, have you ever wondered what happened behind the scenes to get you into that interview chair? Organizations invest serious time and money into figuring out who to hire. And for good reason. The wrong hire can cost a company thousands of dollars in training, lost productivity, and the hassle of starting the search all over again. On the flip side, the right hire can transform a team's performance.

For the EPPP, understanding employee selection techniques isn't just about memorizing a list of methods. You need to know which techniques actually work, why they work, and how organizations combine them to make smart hiring decisions. Let's break this down in a way that'll stick with you long after exam day.

## The Building Blocks: What Are Selection Techniques?

Selection techniques are tools organizations use to predict who will succeed in a job. Think of them as predictors. They're trying to forecast future job performance based on information gathered during the hiring process. The big question every organization faces is: "Which predictors actually work?"

Here's what you need to understand: not all selection techniques are created equal. Some have strong validity (meaning they accurately predict job performance), while others seem like they should work but don't hold up under scientific scrutiny.

## The Heavy Hitters: Seven Core Selection Techniques

### 1. Interviews: More Complex Than They Appear

Interviews come in two main flavors: structured and unstructured.

**Unstructured interviews** are what most of us experience. The interviewer asks whatever comes to mind, follows interesting tangents, and might ask completely different questions to different candidates. {{M}}It's like having a first date where the conversation flows naturally but unpredictably{{/M}}. You might spend most of the time discussing travel experiences with one person and career goals with another.

**Structured interviews** follow a script. Every candidate gets asked the same predetermined questions, often developed from a job analysis, and responses are scored using a standardized system. For years, researchers believed structured interviews were clearly superior predictors of job performance.

Here's where it gets interesting: Recent research using more sophisticated statistical methods found something surprising. Both structured and unstructured interviews have the same average validity coefficient of .58. This challenged decades of conventional wisdom. What matters more than the structure is that interviews, in general, are the second-best predictor of job performance (after general mental ability tests).

Within structured interviews, you'll encounter two important types:

**Behavioral interviews** operate on the principle that past behavior predicts future behavior. Questions sound like: "Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a difficult customer. What did you do?" These questions dig into actual experiences from your past.

**Situational interviews** are future-oriented and hypothetical: "Imagine a customer becomes angry and starts raising their voice. How would you handle this situation?" You're describing what you *would* do, not what you *did* do.

Here's a twist the research revealed: When behavioral and situational questions are designed to assess the same job requirements and asked of the same applicants, situational questions actually predict job performance better. This suggests that intentions about future behavior may be more predictive than past behaviors, a counterintuitive finding worth remembering for the exam.

### 2. General Mental Ability Tests: The Champion Predictor

These tests go by several names: general cognitive ability tests, intelligence tests, or simply cognitive ability tests. Here's what you absolutely need to know: **these are the most valid predictors of job performance** across different types of jobs, performance criteria, and organizations.

Why do they work so well? Intelligence relates to learning ability, problem-solving, and the capacity to handle complex tasks. All crucial for job success regardless of the specific position.

But there's a significant downside: general mental ability tests have the highest risk of adverse impact on applicants from certain ethnic and racial minority groups. This creates a legal and ethical tension for organizations. They want the most valid predictor, but they also need to ensure fair hiring practices.

### 3. Personality Tests: The Big Five and Beyond

Many organizations use personality assessments based on the Big Five personality traits:
- Conscientiousness
- Openness to experience
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Emotional stability

Of these five traits, **conscientiousness** consistently emerges as the best predictor of job performance across different jobs and performance criteria. {{M}}This makes intuitive sense, like choosing a reliable friend to water your plants while you're on vacation{{/M}}, employers want someone who shows up, follows through, and pays attention to details.

The other traits matter too, but their predictive power depends more on the specific job. Extraversion might predict success in sales but matter less for a software developer working independently.

### 4. Integrity Tests: Predicting Counterproductive Behavior

Integrity tests aim to identify applicants likely to engage in theft, dishonesty, or other counterproductive workplace behaviors. They come in two varieties:

**Overt integrity tests** ask directly about attitudes toward dishonesty and past behavior. Questions might include: "Have you ever considered taking something from work?" or "How wrong is it to take office supplies home?"

**Personality-based integrity tests** take a more indirect approach, measuring personality traits linked to counterproductive behaviors like impulsivity, hostility, or irresponsibility.

Here's what the research shows: Overt tests better predict counterproductive behaviors (like theft), while personality-based tests better predict overall job performance. The good news? Integrity tests don't show adverse impact for racial or ethnic minorities, making them a legally safer option than some alternatives.

One more critical finding: When researchers examined which combination of selection methods provides the best prediction, they found that **combining a general mental ability test with an integrity test produces the greatest incremental validity**. In simpler terms, these two together give you more bang for your buck than any other combination.

### 5. Work Samples: Show, Don't Tell

Work samples require applicants to actually perform job tasks under realistic conditions. {{M}}Instead of asking a chef to describe how they'd prepare a dish, you hand them ingredients and watch them cook{{/M}}.

The validity of work samples has shifted over time. Earlier research suggested they were as valid as (or even more valid than) general mental ability tests. However, more recent findings show lower validity coefficients. Why the change? Work samples were traditionally used for manual skilled jobs (like welding or carpentry), where they work exceptionally well. As organizations increasingly use them for service-sector jobs, their accuracy has decreased.

There's a specialized version called **trainability work sample tests** designed for applicants without previous experience. These incorporate training periods followed by evaluation, helping organizations determine whether inexperienced applicants are likely to benefit from on-the-job training.

Work samples often appear in **realistic job previews (RJPs)**, which show applicants both positive and negative aspects of the job. The goal? Reduce turnover by ensuring new hires know what they're getting into before accepting an offer.

### 6. Assessment Centers: The Multi-Method Approach

Assessment centers aren't physical locations. They're comprehensive evaluation processes typically used for managerial positions. They involve multiple raters evaluating candidates on several performance dimensions using multiple methods, including personality tests, ability tests, structured interviews, and simulations.

Two classic simulations you should know:

**The in-basket exercise** assesses decision-making skills. {{M}}Imagine arriving at your desk to find 30 emails, 15 voicemails, and a stack of memos all demanding immediate attention{{/M}}. Participants must prioritize, delegate, respond, and make decisions just as they would in the actual job.

**The leaderless group discussion** evaluates leadership potential. A small group receives a job-related problem to solve together. But no one is appointed leader. Raters observe who emerges as a leader, how they influence others, and how they navigate group dynamics.

The strength of assessment centers lies in their comprehensiveness. By using multiple methods and multiple raters, they reduce the bias and error that can affect single-method approaches.

### 7. Biographical Information: Your History Predicts Your Future

When organizations systematically collect biographical information to predict job performance, they create a **biodata form** or **biographical information blank (BIB)**. These aren't just basic resume facts. Empirically derived items might ask about family history, health history, interests, social relationships, and life experiences.

Questions typically use multiple-choice or other easily scored formats. The items are chosen because research shows they predict job performance, even if the connection isn't immediately obvious.

Biodata works well across job types, from unskilled positions to executive roles. But there's a catch: some items lack **face validity**, meaning they don't appear relevant to job performance. {{M}}If an application asks about your birth order or childhood hobbies, you might wonder what that has to do with managing a sales team{{/M}}. This can lead applicants to view questions as invasive or irrelevant, potentially refusing to answer or viewing the organization negatively.

## Comparison Table: Selection Technique Validity

| Selection Technique | Validity Ranking | Key Advantages | Key Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|---|
| General Mental Ability Tests | Highest (most valid) | Predicts across all job types | Highest adverse impact risk |
| Interviews (Both Types) | Second highest | Flexible, assesses interpersonal skills | Can be time-consuming |
| Integrity Tests | Fourth highest | No adverse impact, predicts counterproductive behavior | May lack face validity |
| Work Samples | Variable (declining for service jobs) | High face validity, job-relevant | Expensive, less valid for service sector |
| Personality Tests | Moderate (conscientiousness best) | Low adverse impact | Lower validity than cognitive tests |
| Assessment Centers | Good for managerial roles | Comprehensive, multiple methods | Very expensive and time-intensive |
| Biodata | Good across job levels | Objective scoring | May lack face validity, privacy concerns |

## Combining Selection Techniques: The Whole Is Greater Than the Sum

Organizations rarely rely on just one predictor. The question becomes: how do you combine information from multiple sources?

There are two main approaches: compensatory and noncompensatory methods.

### Compensatory Methods: Balance Is Possible

With compensatory methods, a high score on one predictor can compensate for a lower score on another. {{M}}It's like balancing your monthly budget, spending more on rent might be okay if you're spending less on transportation{{/M}}.

**Clinical prediction** relies on human judgment. Decision-makers use their understanding of the job to evaluate whether an applicant's overall profile fits the position. The major problem? This approach is susceptible to biases and errors. Research consistently shows that statistical methods outperform human judgment for predicting job performance.

**Multiple regression** is the statistical alternative. Each predictor is weighted based on its correlation with other predictors and with the criterion (job performance). These weighted scores combine to produce an estimated performance score. This method is more accurate than clinical prediction because it's based on mathematical relationships rather than subjective impressions.

### Noncompensatory Methods: Every Hurdle Matters

With noncompensatory methods, a low score on one predictor cannot be compensated for by high scores on others. You must meet minimum standards on every measure.

**Multiple cutoff** administers all predictors to all applicants. To move forward, applicants must score above the cutoff on every single predictor. {{M}}Think of it like college admission requirements where you need both a minimum GPA and a minimum test score. Excellence in one doesn't excuse deficiency in the other{{/M}}.

**Multiple hurdles** takes a sequential approach. Predictors are administered in a specific order, and applicants must pass each hurdle before advancing to the next one. This saves money when some predictors are expensive or time-consuming. Why give an expensive assessment center evaluation to everyone when you can first screen out candidates who don't meet basic qualifications?

These approaches can be combined. Organizations might use multiple hurdles to identify candidates who meet minimum standards on all predictors, then use multiple regression to rank those qualifying candidates and make final decisions.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception #1: "Structured interviews are always better than unstructured ones."**
Reality: Recent research shows they have equal validity (.58). What matters is that interviews in general are strong predictors, regardless of structure.

**Misconception #2: "Past behavior questions (behavioral interviews) are better than hypothetical ones (situational interviews)."**
Reality: When questions assess the same job requirements, situational questions actually predict performance better. Intentions may be more predictive than past behavior.

**Misconception #3: "Work samples are among the best predictors."**
Reality: Their validity has declined as they've expanded from manual skilled jobs to service-sector positions. They're still valuable but not the top-tier predictors they once were.

**Misconception #4: "You should always use compensatory methods to give applicants every chance."**
Reality: Noncompensatory methods make sense when certain minimum qualifications are genuinely essential. Some jobs require minimum capabilities that can't be compensated for by strengths in other areas.

**Misconception #5: "Face validity doesn't matter if a test predicts performance."**
Reality: While statistical validity is crucial, low face validity can cause applicants to refuse to answer questions, view the organization negatively, or even pursue legal challenges.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For the exam, memorize this hierarchy of validity:**
1. General mental ability tests (highest)
2. Interviews (structured and unstructured equal)
3. Job knowledge tests
4. Integrity tests
5. Everything else falls below these

**Remember the best combination:** General mental ability + integrity tests = greatest incremental validity

**Use the acronym GIPWWAB for the seven techniques:**
- **G**eneral mental ability
- **I**nterviews
- **P**ersonality tests
- **W**ork samples
- **W**ait, also assessment centers (okay, the acronym breaks down here, but you get five out of seven!)
- **A**ssessment centers
- **B**iodata

**For interview types, think time orientation:**
- **Behavioral** = **B**ackward looking (past behavior)
- **Situational** = **S**peculative (future hypotheticals)

**For combining methods:**
- **Compensatory** = **C**ompromise possible
- **Noncompensatory** = **N**o excuses, must pass all

## Key Takeaways

- **General mental ability tests are the single most valid predictor** of job performance across all jobs, but they carry the highest risk of adverse impact on minority groups.

- **Both structured and unstructured interviews have equal validity (.58)**, making them the second-best predictor after cognitive ability tests. This challenges older assumptions.

- **Situational interview questions predict performance better than behavioral questions** when both assess the same job requirements, suggesting intentions matter more than past behavior.

- **Conscientiousness is the most predictive personality trait** across different jobs and performance criteria.

- **Integrity tests combined with general mental ability tests provide the greatest incremental validity** of any two-method combination.

- **Overt integrity tests better predict counterproductive behaviors**, while personality-based integrity tests better predict overall job performance.

- **Work sample validity has declined** as their use has expanded from manual skilled jobs to service-sector positions.

- **Assessment centers use multiple methods and multiple raters** to evaluate candidates, typically for managerial positions.

- **Biodata can predict performance across all job levels** but may lack face validity, causing applicant concerns about relevance and privacy.

- **Compensatory methods allow high scores on some predictors to offset low scores on others**, while noncompensatory methods require minimum scores on all predictors.

- **Multiple regression (statistical) outperforms clinical prediction (human judgment)** for combining predictor information.

- **Multiple hurdles saves resources** compared to multiple cutoff by administering expensive predictors only to candidates who've passed earlier, cheaper screening.

Remember: the EPPP loves to test your understanding of which techniques are most valid and why organizations might choose one method over another despite validity differences. Know the trade-offs between validity, cost, adverse impact, and practical implementation. Good luck!
