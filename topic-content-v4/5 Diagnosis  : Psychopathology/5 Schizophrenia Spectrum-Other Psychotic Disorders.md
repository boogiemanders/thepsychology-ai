## Introduction: Why Understanding Psychotic Disorders Matters

You're preparing for the EPPP, which means you're getting ready to work with real people facing real challenges. Among the most misunderstood and stigmatized conditions you'll encounter are psychotic disorders. These aren't rare. About 3% of people will experience a psychotic episode at some point in their lives. Understanding schizophrenia spectrum disorders isn't just about passing an exam; it's about being equipped to help people maintain their relationships, careers, and sense of self when their reality becomes fundamentally disrupted.

Let's break down these disorders in a way that makes sense and sticks with you.

## The Psychotic Disorders Landscape: A Quick Overview

The DSM-5-TR groups several disorders under the psychotic spectrum umbrella. {{M}}Think of this like a continuum of severity and duration. From a brief storm that passes quickly to a chronic condition requiring long-term management.{{/M}} Here's what we're working with:

- **Brief Psychotic Disorder**: Symptoms last 1 day to less than 1 month
- **Schizophreniform Disorder**: Symptoms last 1 to less than 6 months
- **Schizophrenia**: Symptoms persist for 6 months or longer
- **Schizoaffective Disorder**: Psychotic symptoms plus mood episodes
- **Delusional Disorder**: Persistent delusions without other major impairments

## Core Symptoms: The Building Blocks

Before diving into specific disorders, you need to understand the characteristic symptoms. These are your foundation:

### The Five Characteristic Symptoms

1. **Delusions**: False beliefs held firmly despite clear evidence to the contrary. The person with schizophrenia who believes the government planted a tracking device in their tooth isn't being stubborn. They genuinely experience this as real.

2. **Hallucinations**: Perceptual experiences without external stimuli. These have the full clarity and impact of real perceptions. The most common in schizophrenia are auditory hallucinations. Hearing voices that aren't there. Note: This is different from illusions, where an actual stimulus is misperceived (like mistaking a shadow for a person).

3. **Disorganized Speech**: This includes derailment (jumping between unrelated topics) or tangentiality (answering questions in ways that miss the point entirely). {{M}}It's like trying to follow GPS directions when the system keeps recalculating to random destinations. There's no logical path from point A to point B.{{/M}}

4. **Grossly Disorganized or Catatonic Behavior**: This can range from unpredictable agitation to complete immobility. Someone might wear winter coats in summer, or become so rigid they maintain uncomfortable positions for hours.

5. **Negative Symptoms**: These are reductions in normal functioning. Avolition (lack of motivation), alogia (reduced speech), anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure). {{M}}These symptoms are particularly challenging because they look like someone's not trying, when in reality, their brain has lost the capacity to initiate and sustain goal-directed activities.{{/M}}

## The Disorders: Understanding Each One

### Brief Psychotic Disorder

This is the shortest-duration psychotic disorder. The person needs at least one (but possibly more) of the four characteristic symptoms listed above. Though at least one must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. Duration? At least one day but less than one month.

{{M}}Think of this like a psychological crisis response, something overwhelms the system, causing a temporary break from reality, but the system can recover relatively quickly with proper support.{{/M}}

### Schizophreniform Disorder

This is the middle-ground diagnosis. Requirements:
- At least two of the five characteristic symptoms
- At least one symptom must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech
- Duration: at least 1 month but less than 6 months

Notice that now we need **two** symptoms (not just one), and the list expands to include negative symptoms as a fifth option.

### Schizophrenia: The Full Picture

This is where things get more complex. Schizophrenia requires:

**Active Phase** (at least 1 month):
- Two or more of the five characteristic symptoms
- At least one must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech

**Total Duration** (at least 6 months):
- Continuous signs of disturbance including the active phase
- Can include prodromal (early warning signs) and/or residual phases
- During these other phases, symptoms might be attenuated (watered down) or only negative symptoms present

| Disorder | Minimum Symptoms Required | Must Include | Duration |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Brief Psychotic | 1 of 4 symptoms | Delusions, hallucinations, OR disorganized speech | 1 day to <1 month |
| Schizophreniform | 2 of 5 symptoms | Delusions, hallucinations, OR disorganized speech | 1 month to <6 months |
| Schizophrenia | 2 of 5 symptoms | Delusions, hallucinations, OR disorganized speech | 6+ months total |

### What Causes Schizophrenia?

This is crucial EPPP material. Schizophrenia is strongly genetic but not purely genetic.

**The Genetics Story**

Schizophrenia is polygenic, meaning multiple genes contribute to risk. The heritability estimates range from 70% to 80%, which is substantial. But here's what you need to remember for the exam:

| Relationship to Person with Schizophrenia | Concordance Rate |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------|
| General population | 1% |
| Parent | 6% |
| Biological sibling | 9% |
| Child of one affected parent | 13% |
| Dizygotic (fraternal) twin | 17% |
| Child of two affected parents | 46% |
| Monozygotic (identical) twin | 48% |

Notice that even identical twins (with 100% genetic similarity) only have about a 48% concordance rate. This tells you that genes aren't destiny; environment matters too.

Here's a fascinating research finding: When studying identical twins where only one has schizophrenia, the offspring of both twins (affected and unaffected) show similar increased risk. {{M}}It's like carrying a loaded genetic program that doesn't always activate, the unaffected twin carries the code but doesn't run it, yet can still pass it to their children.{{/M}}

**The Brain Chemistry Story**

The original **dopamine hypothesis** suggested schizophrenia resulted from too much dopamine activity. Evidence? Amphetamines increase dopamine and cause psychotic symptoms. Antipsychotic medications block dopamine and reduce psychotic symptoms.

But the story got more nuanced. The **revised dopamine hypothesis** proposes:
- **Positive symptoms** (hallucinations, delusions): caused by dopamine *hyperactivity* in subcortical regions (especially the striatum)
- **Negative symptoms** (avolition, flat affect): caused by dopamine *hypoactivity* in cortical regions (especially the prefrontal cortex)

Other neurotransmitters involved include glutamate and serotonin, but dopamine dominates the research and exam questions.

**The Brain Structure Story**

Common findings in schizophrenia:
- **Enlarged ventricles**: The fluid-filled spaces in the brain are bigger, suggesting loss of brain tissue
- **Hypofrontality**: Reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, contributing to negative and cognitive symptoms

One comprehensive model suggests dysfunction in the temporal-limbic-frontal network causes negative symptoms and disinhibits subcortical areas, which then release excess dopamine in the striatum, causing positive symptoms.

### Schizoaffective Disorder: When Mood Meets Psychosis

This diagnosis is tricky because it requires symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders happening together. Specifically:
- Concurrent symptoms of schizophrenia and a major depressive or manic episode for most of the illness duration
- BUT there must be a period of at least 2 weeks where delusions or hallucinations occur without mood symptoms

{{M}}This is like experiencing two separate health conditions simultaneously. Imagine having both a broken leg and the flu at the same time. They're distinct problems, but they're both affecting you together, making life significantly more complicated than either would alone.{{/M}}

### Delusional Disorder: Highly Focused Beliefs

This is different from schizophrenia in important ways:
- One or more delusions lasting at least 1 month
- Overall functioning is NOT markedly impaired (except for direct effects of the delusion)
- No prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech, or negative symptoms

Someone with delusional disorder might hold their job, maintain relationships, and function normally in most areas. Except for the specific domain affected by their delusion.

**Subtypes to Know:**

| Subtype | Delusion Content |
|---------|------------------|
| Erotomanic | Someone (often of higher status) is in love with them |
| Grandiose | They have special talent, insight, or have made an important discovery |
| Jealous | Their partner is unfaithful |
| Persecutory | They're being conspired against, followed, poisoned, or maligned |
| Somatic | Something is wrong with their body or bodily functions |

{{M}}The jealous type might check their partner's phone obsessively, install tracking apps, and interpret innocent interactions as evidence of infidelity. All while maintaining their job performance and other relationships.{{/M}}

## Course, Onset, and Prognosis: The Timeline

**Typical Onset**

Psychotic symptoms usually first appear between late teens and early 30s. Peak onset:
- Males: early to mid-20s
- Females: late 20s

Why this age range? {{M}}This is when people are typically launching careers, forming serious relationships, and establishing independence, the brain is finalizing its development, and stress levels are often high. The combination of neurobiological maturation and life stress may trigger vulnerable systems.{{/M}}

**What Happens Over Time**

- Psychotic symptoms often decrease with age
- Negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms tend to persist
- This creates challenges because while hallucinations might lessen, motivation and cognitive function continue to struggle

**Better Prognosis Associated With:**
- Female gender
- Acute and late onset (rather than gradual, early onset)
- Comorbid mood symptoms (especially depression)
- Predominantly positive symptoms (rather than negative)
- Clear precipitating factors
- Family history of mood disorder (not schizophrenia)
- Good premorbid adjustment (functioning well before onset)

**Worse Prognosis Associated With:**
- **Anosognosia**: Lack of insight into having the disorder (leads to treatment non-adherence)
- **High expressed emotion** in family: When family members show high criticism, hostility, or emotional overinvolvement

The expressed emotion finding is particularly important. Families who are critical, hostile, or overly enmeshed with the patient increase relapse risk. This doesn't mean families cause schizophrenia. But their response affects recovery.

**Cultural Considerations**

Research shows interesting variations across countries:
- People in non-Western developing countries often experience acute onset, shorter course, and higher remission rates
- The "immigrant paradox" applies: newly arrived immigrants often have better outcomes than more acculturated immigrants or native-born individuals of the same ethnicity

## Common Comorbidities

People with schizophrenia frequently also have:
- Anxiety disorders
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
- **Tobacco use disorder** (this is huge: 70-85% of people with schizophrenia use tobacco, and over half meet criteria for tobacco use disorder)

## Treatment: A Multimodal Approach

Treatment for schizophrenia requires multiple interventions working together.

### Psychosocial Interventions

Evidence-based approaches include:

**Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp)**: Helps people understand and manage their symptoms, challenge distressing beliefs, and develop coping strategies.

**Cognitive Remediation**: Targets cognitive deficits through structured exercises to improve memory, attention, and executive functioning.

**Acceptance and Commitment Therapy**: Helps people accept their experiences while committing to valued actions.

**Assertive Community Treatment**: Intensive, team-based outreach providing coordinated services in the community.

**Family Psychoeducation**: Educates families about the disorder, reduces expressed emotion, improves communication.

**Social Skills Training**: Teaches practical interpersonal skills.

**Supported Employment**: Helps people find and maintain meaningful work.

### Medication

Antipsychotics are divided into three generations:
- First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs): Older medications
- Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs): Newer medications
- Third-generation antipsychotics (TGAs): Newest medications

**Clozapine** (an SGA) is the most effective for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Defined as showing no response or partial response to two adequate trials of antipsychotic medication (at least 6 weeks each at adequate dosage).

Medication non-adherence is a major challenge. Involving family or support systems in care increases adherence and decreases relapse risk.

### Early Intervention Programs

Programs like **NAVIGATE** target people experiencing their first psychotic episode. Components include:
- Family education
- Individual resiliency training (based on CBTp)
- Supported employment and education
- Individualized medication treatment

The resiliency training helps patients understand their psychotic episode triggers, challenge self-stigmatizing beliefs, and strengthen positive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.

## Common Misconceptions

**Misconception #1**: "Schizophrenia means split personality"
- Wrong. That's dissociative identity disorder. Schizophrenia involves a split from reality, not multiple personalities.

**Misconception #2**: "If your identical twin has schizophrenia, you'll definitely get it"
- Wrong. Concordance is only about 48%. Genetics creates vulnerability, not certainty.

**Misconception #3**: "People with schizophrenia are violent"
- Wrong. People with schizophrenia are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence.

**Misconception #4**: "Negative symptoms mean the person is lazy"
- Wrong. Negative symptoms reflect actual brain dysfunction, not lack of effort.

**Misconception #5**: "Brief psychotic disorder isn't serious"
- Wrong. Any break from reality is serious and requires immediate attention, even if temporary.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For Duration Criteria:**

{{M}}Use the acronym "DMS-666" (sounds like "demos"){{/M}}:
- **D**ays (Brief Psychotic: 1 day to <1 month)
- **M**onths (Schizophreniform: 1 month to <6 months)
- **S**ix months+ (Schizophrenia)
- **6**66 reminds you that schizophrenia needs **6** months total, with symptoms present continuously

**For Required Symptoms:**

Create a simple chart in your notes:
- Brief = 1 symptom minimum
- Schizophreniform = 2 symptoms minimum
- Schizophrenia = 2 symptoms minimum

All three require at least one of these: delusions, hallucinations, OR disorganized speech

**For Concordance Rates:**

Remember the pattern climbs with genetic similarity:
- Siblings (9%) < One parent (13%) < Fraternal twin (17%) < Both parents (46%) ≈ Identical twin (48%)

**For Dopamine Hypothesis:**

"SubCort is Positive, PreFront is Negative":
- Subcortical dopamine excess → Positive symptoms
- Prefrontal dopamine deficit → Negative symptoms

**For Better Prognosis:**

Remember "FALA" (sounds like "fa-la"):
- **F**emale gender
- **A**cute onset
- **L**ate onset
- **A**ffective (mood) symptoms present

## Key Takeaways

- **Duration distinguishes disorders**: Brief (<1 month), schizophreniform (1-6 months), schizophrenia (6+ months)

- **Symptom requirements increase with severity**: Brief needs 1 symptom, while schizophreniform and schizophrenia need 2

- **All three require at least one "big three"**: delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech

- **Schizophrenia is highly heritable (70-80%)** but not purely genetic. Environment matters

- **Concordance rates increase with genetic similarity**, peaking around 48% for identical twins

- **Revised dopamine hypothesis**: Subcortical excess causes positive symptoms, cortical deficit causes negative symptoms

- **Negative symptoms persist longer** than positive symptoms and significantly impair functioning

- **Better prognosis factors**: female, acute onset, late onset, mood symptoms, good premorbid functioning

- **Worse prognosis factors**: anosognosia, high expressed emotion in family

- **Schizoaffective disorder** requires both psychotic and mood symptoms, with 2+ weeks of psychosis without mood symptoms

- **Delusional disorder** involves persistent delusions without major functional impairment outside the delusion domain

- **Treatment is multimodal**: psychosocial interventions + antipsychotics + family involvement

- **Clozapine is gold standard** for treatment-resistant schizophrenia

- **Tobacco use disorder** is extremely common (70-85% prevalence) in schizophrenia

- **Early intervention programs** targeting first episodes show promise for better long-term outcomes

Understanding these disorders deeply (not just memorizing criteria) will serve you well on the EPPP and throughout your career. These are real people with real lives disrupted by neurobiological conditions. Your knowledge becomes their pathway to recovery and meaning.
