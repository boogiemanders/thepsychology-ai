## Introduction: Why These Therapies Still Matter

You're studying for the EPPP, and you might be thinking: "Why do I need to know about Freud's couch and Jung's archetypes when most modern therapy is cognitive-behavioral?" Here's the truth: psychodynamic and humanistic approaches shaped every therapy model that came after them, and elements of these theories still show up in clinical practice today. More importantly, the EPPP will test your knowledge of these foundational approaches, and understanding them gives you a framework for comparing other interventions.

Let's break down these classic approaches into concepts you can actually remember and apply.

## The Psychodynamic Perspective: Understanding the Hidden Forces

### Freudian Psychoanalysis: The Original Talk Therapy

Freud's view of human nature was pretty bleak. He believed we're driven by unconscious conflicts from childhood that we can't easily access or resolve. {{M}}Think of it like having important files on your computer that you can't see or open, but they're still running in the background, slowing down your system and causing crashes.{{/M}} Those hidden conflicts create anxiety and problems in the present.

**The Three-Part Personality System**

Freud divided personality into three competing forces:

| Component | Develops | Operates By | Main Drive | What It Wants |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Id** | Birth | Pleasure principle | Sex and aggression instincts | Immediate gratification, no matter what |
| **Ego** | ~6 months | Reality principle | Rational problem-solving | To satisfy id's needs realistically |
| **Superego** | Later childhood | Moral principle | Society's rules internalized | To block id's "bad" impulses completely |

{{M}}Imagine three coworkers trying to make a decision: The id is the impulsive one who wants to skip the boring meeting and go day-drinking. The superego is the rigid rule-follower who insists you must stay for every minute because that's what good employees do. The ego is the one trying to negotiate. Maybe you can attend the important parts and leave early if you finish your tasks.{{/M}}

When the ego can't resolve conflicts between id and superego rationally, it uses defense mechanisms. These are unconscious psychological strategies that distort or deny reality to reduce anxiety.

**Key Defense Mechanisms You Need to Know**

- **Repression**: The foundation of all other defenses. Keeping threatening thoughts completely out of awareness. Not conscious avoidance, but truly not knowing they exist.

- **Denial**: Refusing to acknowledge distressing reality. {{M}}Like someone whose relationship is clearly ending but keeps planning their future wedding.{{/M}}

- **Reaction formation**: Expressing the opposite of what you really feel. {{M}}The person who's intensely anti-something might be defending against their own unacceptable desires related to that thing.{{/M}}

- **Projection**: Attributing your own unacceptable feelings to someone else. {{M}}You're angry at your supervisor, but you're convinced they're the one who's angry at you.{{/M}}

- **Sublimation**: Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities. This is considered the most mature defense mechanism. {{M}}Channeling aggressive impulses into competitive sports or becoming a surgeon.{{/M}}

**The Goals and Process of Psychoanalysis**

The main goal is making the unconscious conscious and strengthening the ego so it can handle reality better instead of constantly defending against it. The therapist analyzes four key things:

1. **Free associations**: Whatever comes to mind without censoring
2. **Dreams**: The "royal road to the unconscious"
3. **Resistance**: When clients avoid certain topics or miss appointments
4. **Transference**: When clients project feelings about important people onto the therapist

The analysis follows four steps:

**Confrontation** → **Clarification** → **Interpretation** → **Working Through**

First, you help clients notice behaviors they weren't aware of. Then you focus on what's important. Then you connect conscious behaviors to unconscious processes. Finally, through repeated interpretation, clients experience catharsis (releasing repressed emotions) and insight, which leads to working through. Gradually accepting and integrating these new understandings into their lives.

### Jung's Analytical Psychology: Beyond Freud

Jung was Freud's protégé who eventually broke away and developed his own ideas. Unlike Freud's pessimism, Jung believed people are driven by both positive and negative forces, that personality develops throughout life (not just childhood), and that we're influenced by both past experiences and future goals.

**The Two Types of Unconscious**

Jung split the unconscious into two parts:

- **Personal unconscious**: Your own forgotten or repressed memories (similar to Freud's idea)
- **Collective unconscious**: Memories shared by all humans, passed down through generations

The collective unconscious contains **archetypes**. Universal patterns of thought and imagery that predispose us to act in similar ways. These show up in myths, dreams, and symbols across all cultures. Important archetypes include the persona (your public mask), shadow (your dark side), hero, and anima/animus (feminine/masculine aspects).

**The Goal: Individuation**

Jung's therapy aims for individuation, which happens mainly in the second half of life. This is the process of becoming a whole, complete individual, integrating all aspects of yourself, including those from the collective unconscious. The therapist uses dream interpretation and transference analysis to bring unconscious material into awareness.

## The Humanistic and Existential Perspective: Freedom, Growth, and Meaning

These approaches emerged partly as a reaction against psychoanalysis's deterministic view and behaviorism's mechanistic perspective. They're sometimes grouped together as "humanistic-existential" therapies, but they have distinct differences.

**What They Share:**
- Focus on the here-and-now
- Phenomenological orientation (your subjective experience matters more than objective reality)
- Rejection of medical model and diagnostic labels
- Focus on internal experience rather than symptoms

**How They Differ:**
- **Humanistic**: Emphasizes acceptance, growth, self-actualization
- **Existential**: Emphasizes freedom, responsibility, authentic engagement with life's inherent anxieties

### Person-Centered Therapy: Creating the Right Conditions

Carl Rogers developed this approach based on one key assumption: humans have an innate drive toward self-actualization, becoming the best version of themselves. Problems arise when there's incongruence between self-concept and actual experience.

**Conditions of Worth: Where Things Go Wrong**

{{M}}Imagine growing up where your parents only showed love when you got straight A's, acted cheerful, and never expressed anger. You learn that your worth is conditional. You're only lovable when you meet certain standards.{{/M}} This creates incongruence. Your actual feelings (sometimes angry, sometimes sad, sometimes just average) don't match the self-concept you need to maintain (always happy, always excellent). You start distorting or denying your real experiences, leading to psychological problems.

**The Three Facilitative Conditions**

Rogers believed that providing these three core conditions creates an environment where clients can grow:

| Condition | What It Means | In Practice |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Empathy** | Understanding the client's perspective and communicating that understanding | "It sounds like you felt completely invisible in that moment" |
| **Unconditional Positive Regard** | Valuing and accepting the client as a person, regardless of their behaviors | Maintaining warmth even when discussing the client's harmful actions |
| **Congruence** | Being genuine, authentic, and honest | Not hiding behind a professional facade; being real |

The goal is helping clients become "fully functioning". Open to experience, living in the present, trusting their own judgment, and actively self-actualizing.

### Gestalt Therapy: Awareness and Contact

Gestalt therapy assumes people are motivated to maintain homeostasis (balance). When physical or psychological needs arise, this balance is disrupted, and we seek something from the environment to restore it. Neurosis happens when there's a persistent problem at the boundary between person and environment.

**Boundary Disturbances**

These are the ways people mess up their contact with the environment:

- **Introjection**: Swallowing others' beliefs whole without examining them. {{M}}Like automatically adopting your family's political views or career expectations without ever questioning if they fit you.{{/M}}

- **Projection**: Putting your own undesirable qualities onto others. {{M}}Assuming everyone else is judging you when really you're judging yourself.{{/M}}

- **Retroflection**: Doing to yourself what you want to do to others. {{M}}Criticizing yourself harshly instead of expressing anger at someone else.{{/M}}

- **Deflection**: Avoiding real contact. {{M}}Changing the subject every time conversation gets emotionally deep.{{/M}}

- **Confluence**: Blurring boundaries between self and others. {{M}}Not knowing where your feelings end and your partner's begin; losing yourself in relationships.{{/M}}

**The Techniques**

Gestalt therapists believe awareness is the curative factor. Two famous techniques:

**Empty chair technique**: The client talks to an empty chair as if someone important is sitting there, or they switch chairs to dialogue between different parts of themselves (like the demanding "top dog" and the resistant "underdog").

**Dream work**: Unlike Freud's symbolic interpretation, Gestalt therapists have clients role-play different elements of their dreams, treating each part as a disowned aspect of the client's own personality.

### Existential Therapy: Confronting Life's Big Questions

Existential therapists believe psychological disturbances come from failing to resolve conflicts around four ultimate concerns:

1. **Death**: We exist now but will cease to exist
2. **Freedom**: We have radical freedom to choose, which is terrifying
3. **Isolation**: We're fundamentally alone in our experience
4. **Meaninglessness**: Life has no inherent meaning; we must create it

**Two Types of Anxiety**

- **Normal (existential) anxiety**: Proportionate to actual threat, not repressed, can be used constructively to motivate positive change

- **Neurotic anxiety**: Disproportionate to threat, involves repression, prevents growth

{{M}}Normal anxiety is like feeling nervous before a major career transition because you're genuinely uncertain about the future. Neurotic anxiety is having panic attacks about leaving your job when you have solid plans, because you're really avoiding deeper questions about whether you've been living authentically.{{/M}}

The goal is helping clients live more authentically, taking charge of their lives, choosing their own values and purposes, and acting in ways that express those values. The therapist-client relationship itself is the primary tool, though therapists may also use questioning, interpretation, and reframing.

### Reality Therapy: Making Better Choices

William Glasser's reality therapy is based on choice theory, which says we have five basic innate needs:

1. Love and belonging
2. Power
3. Fun
4. Freedom
5. Survival

How we choose to meet these needs determines whether we develop a success identity or failure identity.

- **Success identity**: Meeting needs responsibly, in ways that don't infringe on others' rights
- **Failure identity**: Meeting needs irresponsibly, in destructive ways that may not even get us what we want

**The WDEP System**

Reality therapists follow this structured approach:

- **W**ants: What do you want? What are your needs?
- **D**oing: What are you currently doing?
- **E**valuation: How well is what you're doing working for you?
- **P**lan: What's your plan to do something different?

{{M}}It's a straightforward accountability approach. If someone says they want better relationships but admits they ghost people who get too close, the therapist helps them evaluate whether ghosting is getting them what they want and develop a concrete plan for different behavior.{{/M}}

### Positive Psychology: The Science of Well-Being

This is the newest addition to this category. Positive psychology focuses on "valued subjective experiences": well-being, contentment, satisfaction, hope, optimism, flow, and happiness.

**Flow**: A key concept referring to being so absorbed in an activity that nothing else matters. {{M}}That state when you're doing something challenging but well-matched to your skills. Time disappears, self-consciousness fades, and you're completely engaged.{{/M}}

Flow happens most when there's a challenge-skill balance: you believe you have the skills needed, and both the challenge and your skill level are relatively high. A distinctive feature of positive psychology is its commitment to empirical research. Studies have linked positive emotions and optimism to longer life and improved physical health.

### Personal Construct Therapy: Changing How You See Things

George Kelly's approach focuses on how people construe (perceive, interpret, and anticipate) events. His basic insight: there are always alternative ways of understanding what happens, and changing how you construe events can change your behavior and outcomes.

**Personal Constructs**

These are bipolar dimensions of meaning we use to understand the world: fair/unfair, strong/weak, trustworthy/untrustworthy, success/failure. They develop from our experiences and can be conscious or unconscious.

{{M}}If you consistently construe professional feedback as attack/support rather than helpful/unhelpful, you might react defensively to constructive criticism. Shifting to different constructs gives you new behavioral options.{{/M}}

**Fixed-Role Therapy**

Kelly developed this technique where the client role-plays a fictional character (created by the therapist) who construes events differently. By trying out alternative ways of seeing things, clients can discover new possibilities for their own lives.

## Common Misconceptions

**"Psychoanalysis and psychodynamic therapy are the same thing"**
Psychoanalysis is Freud's specific approach. Psychodynamic therapy is the broader category that includes Freudian psychoanalysis, Jungian analytical psychology, and modern approaches like object relations theory and self-psychology.

**"Defense mechanisms are always bad"**
Not true. Occasional use of defense mechanisms is normal and adaptive. It's the rigid, repeated reliance on them that prevents growth and problem-solving. Sublimation, in particular, is considered a mature defense.

**"Person-centered therapy means the therapist just agrees with everything"**
Unconditional positive regard doesn't mean agreeing with everything or avoiding challenge. It means valuing the client as a person while still being genuine (congruent). A person-centered therapist might say, "I care about you and I'm concerned about this pattern I'm seeing."

**"Humanistic and existential therapies are basically the same"**
While they share some similarities, they're philosophically different. Humanistic approaches emphasize growth and self-actualization (an optimistic view). Existential approaches emphasize confronting life's inherent anxieties and meaninglessness (a more sobering view).

**"Reality therapy ignores feelings"**
Reality therapy focuses on behavior and choices, but it doesn't ignore feelings. It just emphasizes that changing behavior is often more effective than trying to change feelings directly.

**"These old theories aren't used anymore"**
Elements of all these approaches still appear in modern integrative practice. Understanding unconscious processes, the importance of the therapeutic relationship, client-centered stance, and helping clients take responsibility are all current practices rooted in these theories.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**For defense mechanisms**, create a personal example for each one. The EPPP loves testing whether you can distinguish between them.

**For the three facilitative conditions** in person-centered therapy, remember the acronym **EUC** (Empathy, Unconditional positive regard, Congruence).

**For Gestalt boundary disturbances**, remember **IPRDC**: Introjection, Projection, Retroflection, Deflection, Confluence. Make a mental image of "I pour DC" or create your own mnemonic.

**For the four ultimate concerns** in existential therapy, remember **DFIM**: Death, Freedom, Isolation, Meaninglessness.

**Compare and contrast**: The EPPP often asks you to distinguish between approaches. Make a table comparing their views on:
- The source of problems
- The role of the past
- The therapist's role
- Primary techniques
- Goals of therapy

**Timeline matters**: Know which came first. Psychoanalysis predates everything else here. Humanistic approaches emerged as a "third force" in response to psychoanalysis and behaviorism. Positive psychology is the newest.

## Key Takeaways

- **Freudian psychoanalysis** views problems as unconscious conflicts from childhood between id, ego, and superego; uses analysis of free associations, dreams, resistance, and transference to make the unconscious conscious

- **Defense mechanisms** (repression, denial, reaction formation, projection, sublimation) operate unconsciously to reduce anxiety; occasional use is adaptive, but rigid reliance prevents growth

- **Jung's analytical psychology** includes the personal unconscious and collective unconscious (with archetypes); aims for individuation through integrating unconscious material

- **Person-centered therapy** assumes an innate drive toward self-actualization; provides three facilitative conditions (empathy, unconditional positive regard, congruence) to help clients become fully functioning

- **Gestalt therapy** focuses on awareness as the curative factor; addresses boundary disturbances (introjection, projection, retroflection, deflection, confluence) using techniques like empty chair and dream work

- **Existential therapy** helps clients confront the four ultimate concerns (death, freedom, isolation, meaninglessness) and live more authentically; distinguishes between normal and neurotic anxiety

- **Reality therapy** uses the WDEP system to help clients replace failure identity with success identity by making responsible choices to meet their five basic needs

- **Positive psychology** is the scientific study of well-being, including the concept of flow; uses empirical research to validate interventions

- **Personal construct therapy** focuses on how people construe events using bipolar personal constructs; helps clients try out alternative ways of perceiving through techniques like fixed-role therapy

- **Humanistic approaches** emphasize growth and self-actualization; **existential approaches** emphasize freedom, responsibility, and confronting life's inherent anxieties. They share some similarities but have distinct philosophical differences

Understanding these foundational approaches gives you the framework for understanding modern integrative therapies and provides essential knowledge for the EPPP's treatment and intervention domain. Focus on distinguishing between approaches, knowing their key techniques and goals, and being able to identify examples of concepts like defense mechanisms and boundary disturbances.
