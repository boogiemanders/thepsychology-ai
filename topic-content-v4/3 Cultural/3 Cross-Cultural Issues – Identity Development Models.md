## Why Identity Development Models Matter for Your EPPP (and Your Practice)

When you're sitting across from a client, understanding their identity development isn't just academic theory. It's the difference between connecting with their experience and missing the mark entirely. A Black client who seems "angry at everyone" might be in the Resistance and Immersion stage, working through justified responses to racism. A White client who insists they "don't see color" might be stuck in the Contact status, unaware of how race shapes their worldview. These models give you a roadmap for understanding where clients are in their journey and how to meet them there effectively.

For the EPPP, you'll need to recognize the stages of each model and their key characteristics. But more importantly, you'll need to understand the pattern: almost all racial and cultural identity models start with people rejecting or being unaware of their cultural identity, then move through conflict and exploration, and finally arrive at acceptance and integration. Think of it {{M}}like learning to embrace parts of yourself you once ignored. Similar to how some people in their twenties reject their family's traditions, then gradually reconnect with them in a more mature, chosen way by their thirties{{/M}}.

## The Big Picture: What All These Models Share

Before we dig into specific models, notice the common thread: identity development typically moves from cultural unawareness or rejection toward cultural acceptance and appreciation. This isn't a smooth highway. People often zigzag, stall, or circle back. But the general direction matters.

Here's the pattern you'll see repeated:

| Early Stages | Middle Stages | Later Stages |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Rejection or unawareness of own culture | Questioning, confusion, conflict | Acceptance and appreciation |
| Preference for majority/dominant culture | Intense focus on own culture | Balance and integration |
| Limited self-awareness | Growing awareness, often painful | Secure identity, less defensive |

## Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's Racial/Cultural Identity Development Model

This is your foundational model. It applies broadly to members of any racial or cultural minority group. The model tracks how people view three groups: their own minority group, other minority groups, and the majority group.

### Stage 1: Conformity

People in this stage have bought into the majority culture's perspective completely. They view their own minority group negatively or neutrally, other minority groups the same way, and the majority group positively. {{M}}It's like when you first start a new job and try to mirror everything the senior employees do, even rejecting input from other newcomers like yourself{{/M}}. They've internalized negative stereotypes about their own group.

**Therapy implications:** These clients want a therapist from the majority group and will resist any attempt to explore their cultural identity. If you bring up their culture, they'll see it as threatening or irrelevant.

### Stage 2: Dissonance

Something cracks the facade. Maybe they experience discrimination directly, or they encounter information that contradicts their worldview. Now they're questioning everything. Their attitudes toward all three groups become uncertain and conflicted.

**Therapy implications:** These clients might still prefer a majority-group therapist, but now they want that therapist to understand their culture. They're actually interested in exploring their cultural identity, unlike in Stage 1.

### Stage 3: Resistance and Immersion

The pendulum swings hard the other way. Now they view their own minority group extremely positively, the majority group negatively, and other minority groups... well, it's complicated. Their feelings about other minority groups are mixed.

**Therapy implications:** These clients are suspicious of mental health services altogether. If they do come to therapy, they'll likely blame racism for their problems (which may be accurate) and strongly prefer a therapist from their own minority group.

### Stage 4: Introspection

The intensity starts to settle. They begin questioning whether their complete allegiance to their own group is limiting them. They're comfortable with their cultural identity but now worried about maintaining their individuality and autonomy within their cultural group.

**Therapy implications:** They may prefer a therapist from their own group but are open to others who truly understand their worldview. They want to explore this new, more nuanced sense of identity.

### Stage 5: Integrative Awareness

They've arrived at balance. They can see positive and negative aspects in all cultural groups, including their own. They're secure in their identity and committed to fighting all forms of oppression, not just the ones affecting their group.

**Therapy implications:** Their therapist preference is based on worldview match, not race or ethnicity. They're most interested in strategies for community and societal change.

## Cross's Black Racial Identity Development Model

This model has gone through several revisions, which tells you something important: identity development theory keeps evolving as we learn more. For the EPPP, know the original five stages and be aware that later versions simplified it.

### The Original Five Stages:

**Pre-Encounter:** Black individuals idealize White culture and view their own Black culture negatively, as an obstacle or source of stigma.

**Encounter:** Something happens that forces awareness of racism's impact. {{M}}It's like suddenly noticing a pattern you'd been blind to. Maybe you realize you've been passed over for promotions repeatedly while less qualified White colleagues advance{{/M}}. This triggers questioning and interest in their own culture.

**Immersion-Emersion:** They reject White culture completely and immerse themselves in Black culture. This is an intense, emotionally charged stage.

**Internalization:** The emotional intensity decreases. They've developed a positive Black identity and can now tolerate or respect racial and cultural differences.

**Internalization-Commitment:** They've internalized their Black identity and commit to social activism to reduce all oppression.

### Later Revisions:

Cross (1991) combined the last two stages into one, reducing the model to four stages. Then Cross and Vandiver (2001) restructured it into three stages with subtypes:

| Stage | Subtypes |
|-------|----------|
| Pre-Encounter | Assimilation, Miseducation, Self-Hatred |
| Immersion-Emersion | Intense Black Involvement, Anti-White |
| Internalization | Black Nationalist, Biculturalist, Multiculturalist |

The subtypes matter because they show that people in the same stage can express it differently. Two people in Internalization might look very different. One might embrace a Black nationalist perspective while another takes a multiculturalist approach.

## Sellers' Multidimensional Model of Racial Identity

Here's where things get interesting. This model breaks from the stage approach entirely. Sellers and colleagues argue that racial identity isn't a linear journey. It varies across time and situations. This model was developed specifically for African Americans.

### The Four Dimensions:

**Racial Salience:** How relevant is race to your self-concept right now, in this specific situation? This changes constantly. {{M}}Your race might barely register when you're grocery shopping in your diverse neighborhood, but become immediately salient when you're the only Black person in a business meeting{{/M}}.

**Racial Centrality:** How important is race to your identity generally? This is relatively stable. For some African Americans, race is absolutely central to who they are. For others, gender, religion, or profession might be more important. Centrality doesn't change much based on situation.

**Racial Regard:** This has two parts:
- *Private regard:* How positively or negatively do you feel about being African American and about African Americans generally?
- *Public regard:* How positively or negatively do you think others view African Americans?

These don't have to match. You might have high private regard (feeling proud of being African American) but low public regard (believing others view African Americans negatively).

**Racial Ideology:** Your beliefs about how African Americans should live and interact with society. There are four types:

| Ideology | Core Belief |
|----------|-------------|
| Nationalist | African American experience is unique; we should control our own destiny with minimal outside input |
| Oppressed Minority | Our oppression is similar to other minorities; we should form coalitions with them |
| Assimilationist | We're similar to other Americans; we should work within the system to change it |
| Humanist | All humans are similar; universal issues (poverty, peace) matter more than racial issues |

The brilliant part? Sellers says your ideology might shift depending on context. You might believe African Americans should support Black-owned businesses (nationalist) while also thinking we should have more social contact with White individuals (assimilationist).

### Why This Model Matters:

It explains why two African Americans with similar beliefs might respond completely differently to the same situation. If race has high salience for one person in that moment but low salience for the other, they'll react differently. Even if they share the same racial ideology and regard.

## Helms's White Racial Identity Development Model

Finally, a model for White individuals. Helms was one of the first to argue that White people have a racial identity too (it's just often invisible to them. The model has two phases (abandonment of racism, then defining a nonracist White identity) with three statuses in each phase. Each status uses a different information processing strategy (IPS)) basically, a mental filter for thinking about race.

### Phase 1: Abandonment of Racism

**Contact:** Unaware of racism, satisfied with how things are, likely have had limited contact with people from minority groups. May claim to be "colorblind." *IPS: Obliviousness.*

**Disintegration:** Now they're aware of contradictions that create moral dilemmas. {{M}}It's like claiming you believe in equality while feeling uncomfortable when your daughter dates someone from a different race{{/M}}. This creates confusion and anxiety. *IPS: Suppression and ambivalence.*

**Reintegration:** They resolve the discomfort by deciding White people are superior and blaming minority groups for their own problems. *IPS: Selective perception and negative out-group distortion.*

### Phase 2: Defining a Nonracist White Identity

**Pseudo-Independence:** Something makes them question their beliefs about racial superiority. They develop a superficial tolerance of minority groups but may show paternalistic attitudes that actually perpetuate racism. {{M}}Like the colleague who champions hiring more diverse candidates but then micromanages the new minority employees because they "need extra help"{{/M}}. *IPS: Reshaping reality and selective perception.*

**Immersion-Emersion:** They're searching for what it means to be White and to benefit from White privilege. This is deep, often uncomfortable work. *IPS: Hypervigilance and reshaping.*

**Autonomy:** They've developed a nonracist White identity, value diversity, and can explore race-related issues without becoming defensive. *IPS: Flexibility and complexity.*

### Why This Matters for Therapists:

Helms argues that a White therapist's identity status directly impacts their effectiveness with minority clients. The best scenario is a "progressive" relationship where the therapist has a more integrated, flexible racial identity than the client. Research supports this. White therapists with higher racial identity statuses show higher multicultural counseling competence.

## Troiden's Model of Homosexual Identity Development

Moving from racial to sexual identity development, Troiden's model tracks how gay and lesbian individuals develop their identity. The key idea: identity is most fully realized when how you see yourself, how you present yourself, and how others see you all align.

### The Four Stages:

**Sensitization (Childhood):** Feeling different from same-sex peers. Girls might feel less feminine, more independent and aggressive than other girls. Boys might feel less interested in sports, less aggressive, more drawn to solitary activities like art or reading.

**Identity Confusion (Middle to Late Adolescence):** They start feeling sexually attracted to same-sex individuals and suspect they might be gay or lesbian. This creates anxiety and uncertainty. They cope through:
- Denial
- Avoidance
- Repair (trying to change)
- Redefinition (viewing it as just a phase)
- Acceptance

**Identity Assumption (Around Age 19-21 for males, 21-23 for females):** They begin accepting their gay or lesbian identity. They seek out social and sexual relationships with other gay and lesbian individuals. They start disclosing their orientation to trusted people. First to other gay and lesbian friends, then to some heterosexual family members and friends.

**Identity Commitment:** They've fully internalized their gay or lesbian identity, accepted homosexuality as a way of life, and are comfortable disclosing their orientation broadly. To family, friends, coworkers.

## Worthington's Multidimensional Model of Heterosexual Identity Development

Most people assume heterosexual identity just "happens" automatically, but Worthington and colleagues argue it's also a developmental process. They define heterosexual identity development as "the individual and social processes by which heterosexually identified persons acknowledge and define their sexual needs, values, sexual orientation and preferences for sexual activities, modes of sexual expression, and characteristics of sexual partners."

### The Five Statuses:

**Unexplored Commitment:** Your sexual identity just reflects what society and family say is acceptable. You haven't really explored what you actually want or believe. {{M}}Like following the career path your parents chose for you without ever considering what you actually want to do{{/M}}.

**Active Exploration:** You're purposefully exploring and experimenting with your sexual needs, values, orientation, preferences for activities, partner characteristics, or modes of expression.

**Diffusion:** You're not actively exploring and you're not committed to anything. You might be confused about many aspects of identity, not just sexual identity. {{M}}Similar to when you're between careers and not sure what direction to take next{{/M}}.

**Deepening and Commitment:** You're moving toward greater commitment to your identified sexual needs, values, orientation, and preferences.

**Synthesis:** You've integrated your sexual identity with your other identities (gender, race/ethnicity, etc.).

### Interesting Research Finding:

Konik and Stewart (2004) found that sexual-minority individuals often described their sexual identity as more salient and identity development as more effortful than heterosexual individuals did. But here's the twist: sexual-minority participants scored higher on global identity achievement, while heterosexual participants scored higher on less advanced stages (foreclosure, moratorium, diffusion). The researchers suggest that the extra effort sexual-minority individuals put into developing their sexual identity might actually help them achieve more advanced development in other areas of their identity too.

## Common Misconceptions Students Get Wrong

**Misconception 1:** "These stages are rigid steps everyone follows in order."

Reality: People can move back and forth between stages, skip stages, or get stuck in one stage. These are descriptive models, not prescriptive formulas.

**Misconception 2:** "Someone in the final stage has 'completed' their identity development."

Reality: Identity development is ongoing. Even people in Integrative Awareness or Autonomy continue to grow and refine their understanding.

**Misconception 3:** "All models work the same way."

Reality: Sellers' Multidimensional Model explicitly rejects the stage approach. It's fundamentally different from the others.

**Misconception 4:** "White people don't have racial identity. These models are only for minorities."

Reality: Helms's model specifically addresses White racial identity development. Everyone has a racial identity, even when it's invisible to them.

**Misconception 5:** "Heterosexual identity development happens automatically."

Reality: Worthington's model argues that heterosexual individuals also go through identity development processes, even though they may require less effort due to social support.

**Misconception 6:** "Earlier stages are 'bad' and later stages are 'good.'"

Reality: Each stage makes sense given the person's experiences and awareness at that point. The goal is understanding, not judgment.

## Practice Tips for Remembering

**Use the Common Pattern:** Remember that most racial/cultural identity models follow the same basic arc: rejection/unawareness → questioning/conflict → acceptance/integration. If you remember this pattern, you can reconstruct most of the stages even if you forget specific names.

**Create a Comparison Table:** Make a simple table comparing the first, middle, and last stages of each model. Notice the similarities.

**Focus on Therapy Implications:** For each stage, ask yourself: "What would this client want from therapy? What therapist would they prefer?" This helps cement the stages in memory and prepares you for application questions.

**Remember the Outliers:** Sellers' model is the odd one out (it's not stage-based. Worthington's model is the other outlier) it's for heterosexual identity. These distinctive features make them easier to remember.

**Use the Revisions as Memory Aids:** Cross's model went from 5 stages to 4 to 3-with-subtypes. The direction is toward fewer, more nuanced stages. This evolution helps you remember the model exists in multiple versions.

**Link Models to Populations:** 
- R/CID Model: Any racial/cultural minority
- Cross's Model: Black Americans (it even has "Black" in the revised name)
- Sellers' Model: African Americans (multidimensional, situation-dependent)
- Helms's Model: White Americans
- Troiden's Model: Gay and lesbian individuals
- Worthington's Model: Heterosexual individuals

**Remember the Key Researchers' Names with Mnemonics:**
- **A**tkinson, **M**orten, and **S**ue = **AMS** (like "I am s-ure about minority identity")
- **Cross** = Crossing through Black identity development
- **Sellers** = Selling a different approach (non-stage model)
- **Helms** = Helping White people see their identity
- **Troiden** = True identity for gay/lesbian individuals
- **Worthington** = Worth noting heterosexual identity development exists

## Key Takeaways

- **All racial/cultural identity models start with cultural rejection or unawareness and move toward acceptance and appreciation**. This is your foundational pattern for the EPPP.

- **Atkinson, Morten, and Sue's R/CID Model has five stages:** Conformity, Dissonance, Resistance and Immersion, Introspection, and Integrative Awareness. Track attitudes toward own group, other minority groups, and majority group.

- **Cross's Black Racial Identity Model evolved from five stages to four to three-with-subtypes:** Original stages are Pre-Encounter, Encounter, Immersion-Emersion, Internalization, and Internalization-Commitment.

- **Sellers' Multidimensional Model breaks from stage theory entirely:** It identifies four dimensions (salience, centrality, private/public regard, and ideology) that vary by situation.

- **Helms's White Racial Identity Model has six statuses in two phases:** Contact, Disintegration, and Reintegration (abandoning racism), then Pseudo-Independence, Immersion-Emersion, and Autonomy (defining nonracist identity). Each uses different information processing strategies.

- **Troiden's Model tracks gay and lesbian identity development through four stages:** Sensitization, Identity Confusion, Identity Assumption, and Identity Commitment, with identity most fully realized when self-identity, perceived identity, and presented identity align.

- **Worthington's Model applies to heterosexual identity development:** Five statuses include Unexplored Commitment, Active Exploration, Diffusion, Deepening and Commitment, and Synthesis.

- **Therapist identity status matters:** Helms argues that White therapists with more advanced identity statuses are more effective with minority clients. Research supports this connection to multicultural competence.

- **Context matters:** Both Sellers' and Worthington's models emphasize that identity can shift across situations and contexts, challenging purely linear stage models.

- **Sexual-minority identity development may enhance overall identity achievement:** Research suggests the extra effort required for sexual-minority identity development may facilitate development in other identity domains.
