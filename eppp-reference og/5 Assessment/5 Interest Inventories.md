# Interest Inventories


Interest inventories are used to assess a person’s relative preferences for different activities and occupations. Research investigating the predictive validity of interest inventories has found that they’re good predictors of job choice, satisfaction, and persistence but less accurate for predicting job success (e.g., Sears, Rudisill, & Mason-Sears, 2006).

1. **Strong Interest Inventory (SII):** The SII is intended for high school and college students and adults. Examinees respond to 291 items using a five-point Likert-type scale that ranges from “strongly like” to “strongly dislike.” The test is computer-scored and results are provided in a personal Profile and Interpretive Report. Scores are provided for the following scales: 

(a) The *General Occupational Themes (GOTs)* provide scores on Holland’s six occupational themes: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional.

(b) The *Basic Interest Scales (BISs)* provide scores on 30 specific interests that represent the six occupational themes. For instance, the basic interests for the social theme are social sciences, counseling and helping, religion and spirituality, human resources and training, healthcare services, and teaching and education.

(c) The *Occupational Scales (OSs)* provide information on the extent to which the examinee’s interests are similar to interests of people of the same gender who are employed in 130 different occupations.

(d) The *Personal Styles Scales (PSSs)* provide scores on the examinee’s preferences with regard to five personal styles: work style, leadership style, learning environment, risk taking, and team orientation.

(e) The *Administrative Indices* provide information on any unusual or inconsistent responses.
Empirical criterion keying was used to construct the Occupational Scales of the SII. This involved comparing the responses of men and women employed in different occupations with the responses of a general representative sample of employed adults. Items that distinguished between the two samples were included in the appropriate Occupational Scale.

2. **Kuder Occupational Interest Survey (KOIS):** The KOIS is intended for high school juniors and seniors, college students, and adults. It includes 100 items that each list three activities and require examinees to choose their most and least preferred activities. Because of the forced-choice format of the items, the KOIS yields ipsative scores that allow intra-individual (but not inter-individual) comparisons. The test is computer-scored and provides examinees with a report containing examinees’ scores and explanatory information for the following scales:

(a) Scores on the *Occupational Scales* indicate the strength of the relationship between the examinee’s interests and those of satisfied workers in 109 occupations.

(b) Scores on the *College Major Scales* indicate the strength of the relationship between the examinee’s interests and those of students who have chosen one of 40 college majors.

(c) The *Vocational Interest Estimates (VIE’s)* indicate the examinee’s preferences for ten interest areas: outdoor, mechanical, computational, scientific, persuasive, artistic, literary, musical, social services, and clerical.

(d) The *Dependability Indices* provide information that’s used to determine the validity of an examinee’s responses.
The development of the Occupational Scales used empirical criterion keying. However, in contrast to the SII Occupational Scales, a general sample was not used; instead, items were included on the basis of their ability to distinguish between different occupational groups.

An online version of the Kuder is available as the Kuder Career Planning System (KCPS). It provides career exploration and planning programs for three age groups: Kuder Galaxy for students in pre-K through grade 5, Kuder Navigator for students in grades 6 through 12, and Kuder Journey for college students and adults. Each program includes its own age-appropriate assessments. For example, Kuder Journey includes the Kuder Career Search with Person Match, the Kuder Skills Assessment, and Super’s Work Values Inventory.
