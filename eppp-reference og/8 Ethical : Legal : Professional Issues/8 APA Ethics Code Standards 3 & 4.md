# APA Ethics Code Standards 3 & 4

**APA Ethics Code Standards 3 & 4
Human Relations:** Standard 3 (Human Relations) provides ethical requirements related to discrimination, harassment, multiple relationships, informed consent, and interruption of services. 

1. **Discrimination:** Discrimination based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or other basis proscribed by law is prohibited by Standard 3.01. Note that this prohibition does not mean that psychologists must accept as clients everyone who requests their services. Instead, psychologists may decide to refer individuals seeking services to other mental health professionals when they believe that an individual’s values, diagnosis, or other characteristic would negatively affect their ability to provide competent services. Knapp and VandeCreek (1993) note, for example, that it’s acceptable for psychologists to refuse to see clients whom they perceive to be unwilling or unable to pay their fees.  

2. **Sexual Harassment:** Standard 3.02 defines sexual harassment as “sexual solicitation, physical advances, or verbal or nonverbal conduct that is sexual in nature” and that (a) “is unwelcome, is offensive, or creates a hostile workplace or educational environment, and the psychologist knows or is told this” or (b) “is sufficiently severe or intense to be abusive to a reasonable person in the context.” It also states that sexual harassment can involve a single severe behavior or multiple persistent behaviors. 

The identification of sexual harassment can be difficult, especially in ambiguous situations. For example, sexual harassment has clearly occurred in a quid pro quo (“something for something”) situation in which an employer demands sexual favors from an employee in exchange for a promotion, salary increase, or other job benefit. But it’s more difficult to determine if a person’s behavior constitutes sexual harassment when the person occasionally tells off-color jokes or makes suggestive comments. However, as noted in Standard 3.02, an ambiguous behavior becomes sexual harassment when the perpetrator continues to engage in the behavior after being told it’s unwelcome or offensive.

3. **Harm:** Standard 3.04 requires psychologists to “take reasonable steps to avoid harming” clients, supervisees, students, and others with whom they work and to minimize the effects of any harm that’s foreseeable or unavoidable. As noted by Fisher (2017), this requirement does not apply to legitimate activities that may cause harm such as assigning a low grade to a failing student or assigning an accurate diagnosis to a client that disqualifies him from receiving disability insurance. 

4. **Multiple Relationships:** As defined in Standard 3.05(a), a multiple relationship occurs when a psychologist has a professional relationship with a person and (a) at the same time, has another professional relationship with that person or with someone closely associated with that person or (b) promises to enter into a relationship in the future with that person or a person closely associated with that person. This Standard does not prohibit all multiple relationships but, instead, only those that “could reasonably be expected to impair the psychologist’s objectivity, competence, or effectiveness … or otherwise risks exploitation or harm to the person with whom the professional relationship exists.” For example, authors commenting on post-therapy friendships with clients point out that they should be avoided because of the potential harm to the clients (e.g., Koocher & Keith-Spiegel, 2016): Post-therapy friendships preclude the clients from returning to therapy and the psychologists from providing them with other professional services in the future (e.g., testifying on their behalf in court cases).

Multiple relationships are also addressed in several APA guidelines. For example, Guideline 12 of the Guidelines for Child Custody Evaluations in Family Law Proceedings (APA, 2022) states that psychologists “aspire to avoid conflicts of interests and multiple relationships.” It also identifies conducting custody evaluations with current or former psychotherapy clients and vice versa as multiple relationships. Similarly, Paragraph 4.02.01 of the *Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology* (APA, 2013) states that “forensic and therapeutic psychological services to the same individual or closely related individuals … [is a multiple relationship] that may impair objectivity and/or cause exploitation or harm.” It also states that, when requested to provide concurrent or sequential forensic and therapeutic services, psychologists should refer the individual to another provider; but, when that’s not possible, “to minimize the potential negative effects of this circumstance.”

Gottlieb’s (1993) decision-making model proposes that psychologists consider three factors when considering whether or not to become involved in another professional relationship with a current client: (a) the power differential between the psychologist and the client, (b) the expected duration of each relationship, and (c) the clarity of termination of each relationship. The greater the power differential, the longer the duration of the two relationships, and the more likely that one or both relationships will resume in the future, the less acceptable it would be to become involved in the multiple relationship.
Finally, Standard 3.05(b) states that, in situations in which a potentially harmful multiple relationship has occurred, psychologists must “take reasonable steps to resolve it with due regard for the best interests of the affected person and maximal compliance with the Ethics Code.” Reasonable steps include discussing the situation with the involved individual(s) and consulting with a colleague to determine the best course of action.   

5. **Conflict of Interest:** Standard 3.06 requires psychologists to refrain from accepting a professional role that could be expected to “impair their objectivity, competence, or effectiveness or … expose a person or organization … to harm or exploitation.”  A psychologist may be violating this prohibition if he or she recommends that current clients buy a product or participate in an ancillary service when the psychologist has a financial interest in that product or service.  

6. **Third-Party Requests for Services:** Standard 3.07 states that, “when psychologists agree to provide services to a person or entity at the request of a third party, psychologists attempt to clarify at the outset of the service the nature of the relationship with all individuals or organizations involved, … [including] the role of the psychologist (e.g., therapist, consultant, diagnostician, or expert witness), an identification of who is the client, the probable uses of the services provided or the information obtained, and fact that there may be limits to confidentiality.” Guidelines for identifying whether the third party or the individual or organization receiving services is the client are provided in ASPPB’s (2015) *Supervision Guidelines for Education and Training Leading to Licensure as a Health Service Provider* and APA’s (2013) *Guidelines for Forensic Psychology*. The *Supervision Guidelines* states that “client” ordinarily refers “to a direct recipient of psychological health care services within the context of a professional relationship including a child, adolescent, adult, couple, family, group, organization, community, or other populations, or other entities receiving psychological services” (p. 2). However, it also states that, “in some circumstances (e.g., an evaluation that is court-ordered, requested by an attorney, an agency, or other administrative body), the client may be the individual or entity requesting the psychological services” (p. 3). In addition, the *Guidelines for Forensic Psychology* states that, in the context of forensic practice, “client” refers to “the attorney, law firm, court, agency, entity, party, or other person who has retained, and who has a contractual relationship with, the forensic practitioner” (p. 19). 

7. **Informed Consent:** Standard 3.10(a) requires psychologists to obtain an informed consent using reasonably understandable language from recipients of their professional services unless providing those services “without consent is mandated by law or governmental regulation or as otherwise provided in this Ethics Code.” Exceptions to obtaining informed consent include conducting court-ordered evaluations and research that requires the use of deception. Standard 3.10 also provides ethical requirements for obtaining informed consent in specific situations:

(a) *Individuals Legally Incapable of Giving Consent:* Standard 3.10(b) states that, when individuals are legally incapable of giving informed consent, psychologists should provide them with an appropriate explanation, consider their best interests, seek their assent, and obtain permission from a legally authorized person when doing so is permitted or required by law. This standard applies to adults who have been found to be legally incompetent and most youth under the age of 18. A special group of minors are unaccompanied immigrant children (UIC), who are youth under the age of 18 who enter the United States without legal immigration status and without a parent or legal guardian in the United States. As noted by Dash (2020), UIC cannot legally consent to treatment because they are minors and are in the custody of Customs and Border Patrol, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or a community sponsor, which are the entities responsible for consenting to their care. Dash also states that the informed consent process for UIC should be consistent with Standard 3.11 of the Ethics Code, which applies to psychological services delivered to or through organizations. It requires psychologists to provide relevant information to the organization holding custody and, when appropriate, to the person (in this case, UIC) who will be directly affected by the services.

Laws that allow minors to consent to their own treatment vary from state to state but often include the following: emancipated minor, mature minor (minors who have sufficient maturity and intelligence to give informed consent), and minors with certain medical conditions such as alcohol or drug addiction or a sexually transmitted disease (Sirbaugh & Diekema, 2011). In addition, consent is presumed when a parent or legal guardian is required to give consent for a minor’s treatment but is not available to do so and the circumstances are life-threatening for the minor (e.g., when the minor is at high risk for suicide). However, in this situation, consent should ordinarily be obtained for any resulting ongoing treatment (McNary, 2014). In the United States, providing emergency treatment to minors in an emergency department without the consent of a parent or legal guardian is permitted by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) of 1986. It supersedes state law and is also known as the “doctrine of implied consent” because it assumes that, if the minor’s parent or guardian were present, he or she would consent to the treatment (Benjamin, Ishimine, Joseph, & Mehta, 2017).

Obtaining parental consent for the treatment of minors who cannot consent to their own treatment can be problematic when parents disagree. In intact families, consent from one parent is usually sufficient. When parents are divorced, the court order will indicate if consent from one or both parents is required. However, regardless of who is legally authorized to consent to a minor’s treatment, it is often in the minor’s best interests to obtain consent from both parents (e.g., because doing so helps ensure that both parents will comply with the treatment plan). If both parents do not consent, resolving this problem might involve (a) agreeing to provide treatment to a minor only with the consent of both parents, (b) helping parents reach consensus by discussing the importance of treatment for their child or, (c) when parents are divorced, suggesting that the parent who is seeking treatment for the minor obtain guidance from their attorney or the court.

(b) *Court-Ordered Services:* Standard 3.10(c) states that, when psychological services are court-ordered or otherwise mandated, psychologists must inform the person about the nature of the services, that the services are court-ordered or mandated, and about any limits of confidentiality. Court-ordered evaluations are also addressed in Paragraph 6.03.02 of the APA’s (2013) *Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology* which states that, when an evaluation is court-ordered, forensic psychologists must describe the nature and purpose of the examination but can conduct it without the examinee’s consent. It also states that, if the examinee refuses to be evaluated, a psychologist “may consider a variety of options including postponing the examination, advising the examinee to contact his or her attorney, and notifying the retaining party about the examinee’s unwillingness to proceed.” Standard 3.10(d) requires psychologists to “appropriately document written or oral consent, permission, and assent.”  Note that the circumstances may determine the required or appropriate type of informed consent. For example, laws or institutional regulations may require a signed written informed consent. And, in some situations, oral consent with documentation is preferable – for example, when providing services to members of certain cultures who object to written consents, when the individual has low literacy skills, or when it’s important to preserve the anonymity of research subjects.   

8. **Interruption of Services:** Standard 3.12 requires psychologists “to make reasonable efforts to plan for facilitating services in the event that psychological services are interrupted by factors such as the psychologist’s illness, death, unavailability, relocation, or retirement or by the client’s/patient’s relocation or financial limitations.” When an interruption in services is foreseeable, a good strategy is to discuss the situation with the client and, as appropriate, provide pretermination counseling and/or referrals. To adequately plan for an interruption in services due to death, the best strategy is for a psychologist to have a professional will that designates a professional executor who will assume responsibility for contacting clients and ensuring the security of client records. The ASPPB’s *Guidelines for Closing a Psychology Practice* states that the professional executor should be someone who understands relevant ethical obligations and legal requirements. It also notes that, ideally, “this individual should be a member of the profession or if this is not possible a member of another regulated health profession … [but] should not be a member of the psychologist’s own family due to the inherent conflict of interest that exists” (2020, p. 8).

**Privacy and Confidentiality:** Standard 4 (Privacy and Confidentiality) covers discussing the limits of confidentiality and disclosing confidential information.

1. **Discussing the Limits of Confidentiality:** Standard 4.02(a) requires psychologists to discuss with recipients of psychological services “the relevant limits of confidentiality and … foreseeable uses of the information generated through their psychological activities.” And Standard 4.02(b) states that, “unless it is not feasible or is contraindicated, the discussion of confidentiality occurs at the outset of the relationship and thereafter as new circumstances may warrant.” The following situations require special consideration:

(a) *Couples and Families:* Standard 10.02 of the Ethics Code requires psychologists working with couples or families to clarify at the outset of therapy which individuals are the clients and “the probable uses of the services provided or the information obtained.” This includes informing all individuals how information shared separately with the therapist by one partner or family member will be handled – i.e., will all information disclosed by an individual be kept confidential or will some or all of the information be shared with the other partner or other family members?  

(b) *Group Therapy Members:* Standard 10.03 requires psychologists who provide group therapy to describe “the roles and responsibilities of all parties and the limits of confidentiality.” Psychologists cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information revealed in group therapy because group members are not ethically bound to maintain confidentiality by professional codes or subject to legal liability if they breach confidentiality (Fisher, 2017). However, psychologists can reduce the likelihood that confidential information will be disclosed by educating group members about the importance of maintaining confidentiality and the possible negative consequences of not doing so and by discussing confidentiality during the screening interview, the initial group therapy session, subsequent sessions as needed, and the final session (Knapp & VandeCreek, 2006).

(c) *Minors*: The right to confidentiality does not extend to clients who are minors except in legally defined situations – e.g., when the minor is emancipated or legally able to consent to his/her own treatment. When a minor’s parent or legal guardian has the right to information disclosed by the minor, a good strategy is to discuss confidentiality with all parties and establish a confidentiality agreement at the beginning of therapy about what types of information will and will not be shared. For example, a psychologist would want to let the parties know that he/she will contact the parents or legal guardian of the minor client when the client is engaging in potentially harmful behavior and the psychologist believes that doing so will help ensure the client’s safety. As noted by Behnke and Warner, in this situation, “regardless of whether an adolescent assents to have information disclosed to a parent, it makes both clinical and ethical sense to tell the adolescent – beforehand, if possible – what information will be shared” and, when appropriate, to include the adolescent in conversations with the parent (2002, p. 4). Finally, psychologists should also inform minor clients and their parents or legal guardians about the circumstances in which psychologists are legally permitted or required to disclose information revealed by a minor client to medical personnel, members of law enforcement, and others – e.g., when the minor poses a severe risk of harm to him/herself or others and when the minor has been physically or sexually abused.

(d) *Deceased Clients:* The Ethics Code does not explicitly address the confidentiality of deceased clients, but most states have laws that allow disclosure of confidential information pertaining to a deceased client only with the authorization from the client’s executor, estate administrator, or other legal representative (Feldman, Moritz, & Benjamin, 2005).

(e) *Members of the Military:* Client confidentiality is not handled in exactly the same way in the military as it is elsewhere, and psychologists providing mental health services in military settings must adhere to Department of Defense rules that limit the confidentiality of mental health information. Johnson (2013) suggests that psychologists working in the military minimize the risk for ethical dilemmas by providing “detailed and exhaustive informed consent regarding the fact that confidentiality can never be guaranteed in the military … [and by maintaining] conservative documentation of the client’s history or private concerns” (p. 109).

(f) *Correctional Facilities:* Haag (2006) notes that psychologists working in correctional facilities often face ethical dilemmas related to confidentiality. According to Haag, “in correctional practice, confidentiality can range from essentially no confidentiality (i.e., court-ordered assessments) to levels of confidentiality present in general psychological practice … with the actual level of confidentiality [typically being] somewhere between these two extremes” (p. 97). He states that, for this reason, it’s important to describe the limits to confidentiality to all involved parties at the beginning of professional services. 
Pinta (2009) proposes that decisions about breaches of confidentiality made by psychologists providing therapy to prison inmates can be categorized as treatment- or security-driven: When making treatment-driven decisions, the therapeutic relationship ordinarily has priority and “principles of confidentiality and beneficence (i.e., acting in the best interests and welfare of patients) are given strict adherence” (p. 151). In contrast, when making security-driven decisions, “the confidential nature of the treatment relationship is respected, but the safety of staff and inmates is given greater importance when there are conflicting values” (p. 152). For example, with regard to the duty to protect (see the description of *Tarasoff* below), Pinta (2010) notes that, when an incarcerated client reveals to a psychologist that he/she is planning to harm the correctional staff or another inmate and the psychologist believes the threat is serious, the psychologist would meet the duty to protect by breaching confidentiality and reporting the threat to the warden or other appropriate prison official. However, when an inmate reveals that he/she is planning to harm someone outside the prison, the duty to protect may not apply because the inmate does not have the ability to carry out his or her threat. In this situation, the inmate should receive treatment aimed at reducing the risk of violence if the threat is related to a serious mental disorder. Or, if there’s reason to believe that the intended victim is at risk (e.g., because the inmate is scheduled to be released from prison in the near future or the intended victim is on the inmate’s visitor list), it may be necessary to breach confidentiality by notifying the intended victim or prison officials.

(g) *Employee Assistance Programs*: Employee assistance programs (EAPs) “are designed to help employees address both work-related problems and personal problems outside of work that may be having an adverse effect on job performance” (Chernoff, 2020, p. 254). Client confidentiality is handled in EAPs in the same way it is handled in other therapy situations: This means that confidential information is not shared with an employee’s supervisor or employer without the employee’s signed written authorization, regardless of whether the employee’s participation in the EAP is the result of a self-referral or an informal or mandatory supervisor/employer referral (Government of Canada, 2008; Pitts, 2007). However, as in other circumstances, confidentiality may be breached without the employee’s authorization when doing so is legally required or permitted – e.g., to notify appropriate authorities when the employee is a danger to self or others or to report child abuse.

(h) *Telepsychology:*  APA’s *Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology* notes that telepsychology “introduces risks to patient privacy and confidentiality” (APA Task Force on Telepsychology, 2024, p. 1). Methods for maintaining confidentiality and privacy include delivering telepsychology services from a private and soundproof room; discussing with clients the steps they can take to maintain confidentiality and privacy; having password protection on all devices that will be used to provide telepsychology; using encryption for emails, text messages, scanned documents, and other confidential data; ensuring that virus and malware protections are up-to-date and that methods for storing and disposing of confidential information are secure; and using videoconferencing platforms that provide adequate security and privacy. In the United States, videoconferencing platforms must comply with HIPAA and state security requirements. HIPAA-compliant platforms utilize appropriate encryption; have secure transmission, audit trails, and breach notification procedures; and will enter into a business associate agreement (Larson, 2019). HIPAA-compliant platforms include Mend, SecureVideo, Spruce, Doxy.me, thera-LINK, Zoom for Healthcare, Webex for Healthcare, GoToMeeting, and Skype for Business (but <u>not</u> Consumer Skype).

**2. Disclosing Confidential Information:** Disclosure of confidential client information is covered in several standards of the Ethics Code, including Standard 4.05. It permits disclosure of confidential information (a) with appropriate authorization to release information from the client or the client’s legal representative or (b) without authorization “only as mandated by law, or where permitted by law for a valid purpose such as to … protect the client/patient, psychologist, or others from harm.” Standard 4.05(b) applies to several situations, including the following:

(a) **Risk for Suicide:** When psychologists believe a client is at high risk for suicide, they must take appropriate action to protect the client’s safety. In some situations, this may require breaching client confidentiality – for example, when the psychologist determines that the best course of action is to contact the client's family or have the client hospitalized. [Note that no-suicide contracts are sometimes used in this situation, but there is no evidence that they are effective for preventing suicide or protecting psychologists from malpractice liability when a client commits suicide. Consequently, they should not be used as the sole intervention.]  

(b) **Risk for Abuse:** Mandatory reporting laws require psychologists to make a report to child protective services or other designated authority when they have reasonable cause to suspect that a child has been abused or neglected. Some jurisdictions also have mandatory reporting laws for the abuse and neglect of other vulnerable individuals such as older adults and adults with disabilities.  

(c) **Risk for Physical Harm:** Many jurisdictions have passed legislation that is consistent with the *Tarasoff* decision, a California Supreme Court decision that established a psychologist’s duty to protect a third party who is at risk for physical harm by a therapy client. In most jurisdictions, the duty to protect applies only when the client communicates a clear and imminent threat of physical harm to an identifiable victim or victims and the client has the ability to carry out the threat. When *Tarasoff* applies, the appropriate action depends on the provisions of relevant legislation but may include warning the intended victim, notifying the police, or hospitalizing the client. 

The application of *Tarasoff* to some situations can be complex. For example, when therapy clients are HIV+ and reveal they are engaging in behaviors that put others at risk for being infected, ethical responsibilities may not be consistent with legal requirements. With regard to legislation, APA has taken the position that "legislation should not impose a legal duty to protect third parties from HIV infection … [but, if] state legislation is proposed, it should permit disclosure only when (a) the provider knows of an identifiable third party who the provider has compelling reason to believe is at significant risk for infection; (b) the provider has a reasonable belief that the third party is unaware the client/patient is living with HIV; and (c) the client/patient has been urged to inform the third party and has either refused or is considered unreliable in the individual’s willingness to notify the third party" (2019, p. 1). APA (2005) also recommends that, in this situation, psychologists identify applicable laws (laws of some jurisdictions require or allow psychologists to warn identifiable at-risk individuals, while others prohibit them from doing so) and seek consultation with colleagues and attorneys. 

Standards 4.04, 4.06, and 4.07 of the Ethics Code address disclosing confidential client information in specific situations. Standard 4.04(a) requires psychologists to “include in written and oral reports and consultations only information germane to the purpose for which the communication was made.” This requirement echoes the requirements of Paragraph 10.01 of APA’s (2013) *Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology*, which states that “forensic examiners seek to assist the trier of fact to understand evidence or determine a fact in issue, and they provide information that is most relevant to the psycholegal issue.” 

Standard 4.06 allows psychologists to consult with colleagues about clients but requires them not to disclose identifying information about a client to a consultant without the client’s authorization and to disclose only information “necessary to achieve the purposes of the consultation.” Standard 4.07 states that psychologists must not use confidential information in “writings, lectures, and other public media … unless (1) they take reasonable steps to disguise the person or organization, (2) the person or organization has consented in writing, or (3) there is legal authorization for doing so." Fisher (2022) notes that simply substituting a pseudonym for the client’s name is not likely to be sufficient, and she recommends that psychologists consider changing other identifying information such as the names of other individuals, birthdates, family composition, locations, and year of the event.

**3. Client Access to Records:** The Ethics Code does not address client access to therapy records, but access is covered by federal, state, and provincial laws. For example, HIPAA’s Privacy Rule gives clients the right to inspect and obtain a copy of their protected health information (PHI). However, it also allows psychologists to deny clients access to PHI when they believe access “is reasonably likely to endanger the life or safety of the individual or another person” [Section 164.524(a)(3)(i)]. HIPAA also addresses access to records when (a) the client is a minor and (b) a minor client turns 18: When the client is a minor, HIPAA allows parents, as the legal representatives of their children, to have access to their children’s PHI unless access is prohibited by law. For example, parents may not have access when state law allows children to legally consent to their own treatment or when treatment is the result of a court order (Office for Civil Rights, 2002a). When minor clients become adults, they have all of the rights granted by the Privacy Rule regarding their own PHI, including PHI that was obtained about them when they were minors. In this situation, parents are usually no longer the legal representatives of their children and, consequently, no longer have access to their children’s PHI without the children’s authorization (Office for Civil Rights, 2002b; Total Medical Compliance, n.d.).

4. **Confidentiality versus Privilege:** Confidentiality and privilege are sometimes confused. However, maintaining client *confidentiality* is an ethical obligation and, in some circumstances, a legal requirement, while *privilege* (privileged communication) is a legal term that refers to a client’s right to confidentiality in legal proceedings. All 50 states have established laws that create some form of the psychotherapist-client privilege.
The client or the client’s legal representative is the holder of the privilege, which means that the client or his/her legal representative decides whether to claim (assert) or waive the privilege. However, psychologists may claim the privilege on behalf of a client when asked to disclose confidential client information in a legal proceeding. In addition, there are legally defined exceptions to privilege, and the court determines whether an exception applies in a particular circumstance. Legal exceptions to privilege vary, but common exceptions include cases in which the court has ordered an examination of a person to determine his/her competence to stand trial, a person is suing his/her therapist for malpractice, and a person is using his/her mental status as a claim or defense in a legal case.
