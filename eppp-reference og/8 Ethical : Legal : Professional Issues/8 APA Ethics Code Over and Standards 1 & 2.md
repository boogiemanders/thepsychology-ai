# APA Ethics Code Over and Standards 1 & 2


**APA Guidelines and Standards:** The APA distinguishes between guidelines and standards: “The term guidelines refers to statements that suggest or recommend specific professional behavior, endeavor, or conduct for psychologists. Guidelines differ from standards in that standards are mandatory and may be accompanied by an enforcement mechanism. Thus, guidelines are aspirational in intent. They are intended to facilitate the continued systematic development of the profession and to help assure a high level of professional practice by psychologists” (APA, 2002, p. 1048). The APA also distinguishes between practice and treatment guidelines: Practice guidelines provide recommendations for professional conduct in specific areas of psychological practice (e.g., telepsychology, forensic psychology). Treatment guidelines are also known as clinical practice guidelines and provide recommendations for treatments that psychologists provide to clients for specific disorders and conditions (e.g., the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder).   
**Ethical Decision-Making:** Fisher's (2022) ethical decision-making model is similar to other models and describes six steps in the decision-making process: (1) Identify the ethical problem. (2) Identify relevant APA principles, standards, and guidelines and institutional or organizational policies. (3) Identify relevant laws and regulations. (4) Consider the perspectives of stakeholders who will be affected by the decision. (5) Consider alternatives and develop and implement an action plan. (6) Monitor and evaluate the results of the action plan. 

APA’s (2016) *Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct* (“Ethics Code”) consists of four sections:
(a) The Introduction and Applicability section states that the Ethics Code “applies only to psychologists’ activities that are part of their scientific, educational, or professional roles as psychologists.” However, it also states that the APA Ethics Committee may take action against APA members not only in response to a complaint of unethical conduct but also after a member’s “conviction of a felony, expulsion or suspension from an affiliated state psychological association, or suspension or loss of licensure.” As noted by Fisher (2022), a felony conviction does not have to be directly related to activities psychologists performed in their professional roles for APA to take action. In other words, APA may act in cases of a felony conviction when there is a direct or indirect relationship between a psychologist’s personal action and professional role. Pipes et al. (2005) provide several questions psychologists can ask themselves to help determine if their personal actions overlap their professional roles: (a) Does the personal action seem to be at least partially professional? (b) Is there a high probability that the personal action will negatively and significantly affect clients, students, or research participants?  (c) Does the personal action threaten their own credibility or the credibility of the profession of psychology? 

(b) The Preamble states that the primary goals of the Ethics Code are to ensure “the welfare and protection of the individuals and groups with whom psychologists work and the education of members, students, and the public regarding ethical standards of the discipline.”

(c) The Ethics Code includes five General Principles which provide aspirational guidelines that are intended to “inspire psychologists toward the very highest ethical ideals of the profession.” Unlike the enforceable Ethical Standards, the General Principles, “should not form the basis for imposing sanctions.” Principle A (Beneficence and Nonmaleficence) states that “psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm.” Principle B (Fidelity and Responsibility) calls for psychologists to “establish relationships of trust with those with whom they work … [and to be] aware of their professional and scientific responsibilities to society and to the specific communities in which they work.” It also states that “psychologists strive to contribute a portion of their professional time for little or no compensation or personal advantage.” Principle C (Integrity) addresses the importance of promoting “accuracy, honesty, and truthfulness in the science, teaching, and practice of psychology.” Principle D (Justice) calls for psychologists to “recognize that fairness and justice entitle all persons to access to and benefit from the contributions of psychology and to equal quality in the processes, procedures, and services being conducted by psychologists.” Principle E (Respect for People’s Rights and Dignity) states that psychologists “respect the dignity and worth of all people, and the rights of individuals to privacy, confidentiality, and self-determination” and “are aware of and respect cultural, individual, and role differences, including those based on age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, language, and socioeconomic status.”

(d) The Ethical Standards are “enforceable rules of conduct” that are mandatory and can be enforced by the APA Ethics Committee and other state or professional organizations that adopt the Ethics Code. The Ethical Standards are divided into ten categories: Resolving Ethical Issues, Competence, Human Relations, Privacy and Confidentiality, Advertising and Other Public Statements, Record Keeping and Fees, Education and Training, Research and Publication, Assessment, and Therapy.
**Resolving Ethical Issues:** Standard 1 (Resolving Ethical Issues) of the Ethics Code addresses conflicts between ethical and legal or organizational requirements, ethical violations by colleagues, responding to requests from ethics committees, and avoiding unfair discrimination against complainants and respondents in an ethics complaint.

1. **Resolving Ethical and Legal/Organizational Conflicts:** Conflicts between ethical requirements and laws, regulations, and organizational demands are addressed in the Introduction and Standards 1.02 and 1.03 of the APA Ethics Code. For example, Standard 1.02 states that, when conflicts occur, “psychologists clarify the nature of the conflict, make known their commitment to the Ethics Code, and take reasonable steps to resolve the conflict consistent with the General Principles and Ethical Standards of the Ethics Code.” It also states that, “under no circumstances may this standard be used to justify or defend violating human rights.” This provision requires psychologists to make a reasonable effort to resolve a conflict in a way that’s consistent with ethical responsibilities but does not require them to abide by ethical responsibilities in all situations. As noted by Fisher, “when reasonable actions taken by psychologists do not resolve the conflict, they are permitted to make a conscientious decision to comply with the legal or regulatory authority under circumstances in which their actions cannot be used to justify or defend violating human rights” (2017, p. 59).

2. **Ethical Violations by Colleagues:** Responding to ethical violations by colleagues is addressed in Standards 1.04 and 1.05: Standard 1.04 requires psychologists to attempt to resolve another psychologist’s ethical violation informally by bringing the violation to the psychologist’s attention when it seems appropriate to do so. Standard 1.05 requires psychologists to report an ethical violation to an ethics committee, licensing board, or other appropriate authority or to take other “action appropriate to the situation” when the ethical violation has caused or is likely to cause substantial harm, is not appropriate for informal resolution, or was not adequately resolved informally. Note that the requirements of Standards 1.04 and 1.05 apply only when intervening does not violate any confidentiality rights. However, as noted by O’Connor (2008), psychologists must be aware that there are situations when confidentiality requirements are superseded by jurisdictional requirements that mandate a violation of confidentiality (e.g., by state laws that require reporting of child and elder abuse).

Koocher and Keith-Spiegel (2008) have identified several situations that may not be amenable to informal resolution. For example, informal resolution may not be appropriate or possible when the psychologist’s violation involves addiction to alcohol or drugs or is related to a serious emotional disturbance or mental illness, when the violation is due to the psychologist’s general incompetence, or when pre-existing bad feelings between the psychologists would make an informal approach too confrontational.   
   
3. **Requests from Ethics Committees:** Standard 1.06 requires psychologists to cooperate with investigations and proceedings of the APA and affiliated psychological associations to which they belong, and it states that failing to do so constitutes an ethical violation. However, like Standards 1.04 and 1.05, Standard 1.06 requires psychologists to consider issues related to confidentiality. For instance, if you’re asked by an ethics committee to provide it with information about a current client who has filed a complaint against her previous therapist, you’d want to make sure the client has signed an authorization for release of information before doing so.   

4. **Unfair Discrimination:** Standard 1.08 states that psychologists must not discriminate against others when making decisions about their employment, advancement, tenure, or admissions to academic programs solely because they’ve filed or are the subjects of an ethics complaint. However, it also states that this prohibition “does not preclude taking action based upon the outcome of such proceedings or considering other appropriate information.”
**Competence:** Standard 2 (Competence) of APA’s Ethics Code addresses working within the boundaries of one’s competence, delegating work to others, and dealing with personal problems. 

1. **Boundaries of Competence:** Standard 2.01 requires psychologists to “provide services, teach, and conduct research with populations and in areas only within the boundaries of their competence, based on their education, training, supervised experience, consultation, study, or professional experience.” Standard 2.01 also addresses competence in specific situations: For example, Standard 2.01(b) applies to situations in which scientific or professional knowledge has established that an understanding of issues related to gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, or other characteristic is essential for ensuring that professional services are effective. It states that, to provide services to individuals with these characteristics, psychologists must have the necessary knowledge and training; and, if they do not, they should make appropriate referrals.

Standards 2.01(c), 2.01(d), and 2.02 apply when psychologists want or are asked to provide services that are outside their current boundaries of competence: Standard 2.01(c) states that, when psychologists want to provide services to new populations or use new techniques, they “undertake relevant education, training, supervised experience, consultation, or study.” This situation is addressed by Koocher and Keith-Spiegel (2008), who note that determining whether it’s better to refer or treat a client whose needs are outside a psychologist’s level of competence depends on the circumstances: When there’s a substantial difference between the client’s needs and the psychologist’s competence and an alternative provider is available, referral is ordinarily the best choice. But, in other circumstances, seeing the client while obtaining consultation and/or additional training and education may be an acceptable course of action.

Standard 2.01(d) applies when psychologists are asked to provide services when they do not have adequate competence and alternative services are not available. It states that psychologists may provide the services when they have closely related training and experience and make a “reasonable effort” to obtain appropriate knowledge, training, and/or consultation. Standard 2.02 allows psychologists to provide professional services in emergency situations, even if they do not have adequate training, when alternative services are unavailable and they discontinue the services as soon as the emergency has ended or appropriate services become available. 

Standard 2.01(e) addresses the use of new techniques for which there is no consensus about what constitutes competence. It states that, “in those emerging areas in which generally recognized standards for preparatory training do not yet exist, psychologists nevertheless take reasonable steps to ensure the competence of their work and to protect clients/patients, students, supervisees, research participants, organizational clients, and others from harm.” Since its emergence, telepsychology has continued to evolve, and the maintenance of competence for the provision of telepsychology services is addressed in Guideline 1 of the APA’s *Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology* (APA Task Force on Telepsychology, 2024). It recommends that psychologists who provide telepsychology services “take reasonable steps to ensure awareness of evolving competencies that are relevant to their practice and patient/client/service outcomes as indicated by up-to-date research and other relevant literature” (p. 6). It notes that “a lack of resources for a specific competency or application of telepsychology to a specific population or service does not necessarily suggest that the use of telepsychology is ineffective.” Guideline 1 also states that, when psychologists decide to provide telepsychology services that have incomplete information about their effectiveness, they “engage patients in a thorough, documented informed consent process that reviews the available information, risks, and benefits regarding a service” (p. 7).

Finally, Standard 2.04 requires psychologists to base their work on “established scientific and professional knowledge of the discipline.” This includes using evidence-based methods of assessment and treatment when they’re available and applicable to a particular client and situation. As defined by the APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice, “evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP) is the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences” (2006, p. 273).

2. **Delegating Work to Others:** Standard 2.05 states that a psychologist must delegate responsibilities to employees, supervisees, research assistants, interpreters, and others only when (a) the person the work is being delegated to does not have a multiple relationship with the recipient of the services that could impede his or her objectivity and effectiveness; (b) the person has adequate competence to provide the services independently or while being supervised as determined by his/her education, training, and experience; and (c) the psychologist ensures that the person provides the services competently. For example, it would be unethical for a therapist to recruit a therapy client’s family member to act as an interpreter when the client does not speak the same language as the therapist because the family member’s relationship with the client is likely to affect his/her objectivity.  

With regard to the use of an interpreter, Novotney (2020) notes that not all jurisdictions require interpreters to be licensed or certified, and she recommends that, whenever possible, psychologists use the services of professional interpreters who are certified by a national organization (e.g., the National Board of Certification for Medical Interpreters) and adhere to the National Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the National Council on Interpreting in Health Care. She also states that it’s important to obtain a client’s consent before bringing in an interpreter to assist with therapy or assessment and to discuss with the interpreter the need to maintain client confidentiality. Tribe and Thompson (2017) recommend that psychologists have written guidelines and a contract for interpreters that address confidentiality and other relevant issues, and Novotney states that psychologists who are subject to HIPAA must have a business associate agreement with the interpreter that specifies the interpreter’s responsibilities with regard to confidentiality. 

When delegating work to an employee or supervisee, psychologists must be aware that, in certain circumstances, they may be subject to *vicarious liability* – i.e., they may be legally responsible for the actions of the employee or supervisee. For vicarious liability to occur, (a) the psychologist must have the authority to control the employee or supervisee, (b) the employee’s or supervisee’s conduct must have deviated from the standard of care and must be the cause of the damage to the recipient of the services, and (c) the employee’s or supervisee’s conduct must have been within the scope of his or her designated responsibilities (Meyer, Simon, & Shuman, 2010).

3. **Personal Problems:** Standard 2.06 requires psychologists to (a) refrain from beginning a professional activity when it’s likely that a personal problem will impede the psychologist’s effectiveness and (b) “take appropriate measures” when they become aware that a personal problem might negatively affect an ongoing professional activity. It also states that an appropriate measure might be to seek consultation to determine whether an ongoing professional activity should be limited, suspended, or terminated.
