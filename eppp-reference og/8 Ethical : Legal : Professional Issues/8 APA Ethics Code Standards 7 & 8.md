# APA Ethics Code Standards 7 & 8


**Education and Training Programs:** Standard 7.02 requires psychologists to take “reasonable steps” to ensure that descriptions of their education and training programs are accurate. For example, a continuing education course on hypnotherapy should not be described as “interactive” or “experiential” if it consists only of a two-hour lecture. Similarly, Standard 7.03 requires psychologists to ensure that course syllabi provide accurate information “regarding the subject matter to be covered, bases for evaluating progress, and the nature of course experiences.” It notes, however, that psychologists may change course requirements when they believe doing so will be beneficial for students; but, in this situation, they must make students aware of the change “in a manner that enables them to fulfill course requirements.” 

Standards 7.04 and 7.05 address course and program requirements. Standard 7.04 states that psychologists must not require students to disclose personal information in course- or program-related activities unless “(1) the program or training facility has clearly identified this requirement in its admissions and program materials or (2) the information is necessary to evaluate or obtain assistance for students whose personal problems could reasonably be judged to be preventing them from performing their training- or professionally related activities in a competent manner or posing a threat to the students or others.” Standard 7.05 states that, when individual or group therapy is a requirement for an undergraduate or graduate course or program, students must be given the option of choosing a therapist who is unaffiliated with the course or program. In addition, “faculty who are or are likely to be responsible for evaluating students’ academic performance … [must not] themselves provide that therapy.” Fisher (2017) provides the following guidelines for programs that require personal psychotherapy: (a) The requirement for mandatory personal psychotherapy is justified by the program’s training objectives. (b) The requirement, its potential risks and benefits, and planned safeguards are described in program application materials. (c) Students are given some choice in their selection of therapists. (d) There will be no multiple relationships between students and therapists. (e) Students are given financially feasible choices for therapy so that it is affordable.

**Assessment of Student and Supervisee Performance:** Requirements for assessing the performance of students and supervisees are provided in Standard 7.06, which states that psychologists must “establish a timely and specific process for providing feedback to students and supervisees” and should give them information about this process at the beginning of the academic or supervisory relationship. It also requires evaluations to be based on the actual performance of students and supervisees with regard to “relevant and established program requirements.” In other words, evaluations must not be based on personality characteristics or other factors that are not clearly linked to a student’s or supervisee’s actual performance.

The dismissal of supervisees is not explicitly covered in the Ethics Code but is addressed elsewhere. For example, Corey, Haynes, Moulton, and Muratori note that “supervisees have due process rights … and dismissal from a training program should be the last resort after other interventions have failed to produce any change in supervisees who exhibit deficiencies” (2010, p. 153). During the course of supervision, a supervisor must provide supervisees with regular constructive feedback and, when a supervisee exhibits problem behavior, the supervisor should provide the supervisee with appropriate remediation, which may include one or more of the following: increasing the amount of supervision, changing the format and/or focus of supervision, recommending personal therapy, reducing the supervisee’s workload, requiring completion of academic coursework, or recommending a leave of absence or second internship in another setting. When these interventions do not satisfactorily rectify the problem, more formal action is taken and might involve placing the supervisee on probation, giving the supervisee a limited endorsement that indicates the settings in which he/she can function adequately, or terminating the supervisee from the training program. Of course, any of these actions must be adequately documented and done in ways that are consistent with the supervisee’s right to due process procedures.

**Sexual Relationships with Students and Supervisees:** Standard 7.07 prohibits psychologists from becoming sexually involved with students or supervisees “who are in their department, agency, or training center or over whom … [they] have or are likely to have evaluative authority.”
**Institutional Approval for Research:** Standard 8.01 of the Ethics Code states that, when institutional approval is required for research, "psychologists provide accurate information about their research proposals and obtain approval prior to conducting the research.” In the United States, projects that involve human subjects and meet the federal definition of research must be reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), which is responsible for protecting the rights and welfare of research subjects: As defined in the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects [45 CFR Section 46.102(l)], research is “a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” IRB members determine which of three types of review are required for submitted research proposals: full review, expedited review, or exempt review. Federal law also requires that, when a research proposal has been reviewed and approved or exempted by the IRB, investigators (a) must obtain informed consents from research subjects or their legally authorized representatives prior to subjects’ participation unless the IRB has waived this requirement and (b) must obtain IRB approval for modifications to the proposal before implementing the modifications. With regard to the latter, for research approved following full or expedited review, a modification request is required for both minor and major modifications; for research with exempt status, a modification request is necessary only for major modifications. Minor modifications include adding new minimal risk procedures, changing recruitment materials and procedures, removing questions from a questionnaire or other instrument, and making minor changes to the informed consent form. Major modifications include adding procedures that increase the risk of harm to subjects beyond minimal risk, making major changes to the research design, adding subjects from new vulnerable populations, adding sensitive questions to questionnaires or other instruments, and adding procedures that may breach the confidentiality of subjects. Finally, while it is not necessary to get IRB approval before making changes designed to eliminate immediate hazards to subjects, these changes must be reported to the IRB as soon as possible.

**Informed Consent for Research**: Informed consent for research is covered in Standards 8.02 through 8.05. Standard 8.02 states that prospective research participants should be given the following information during the informed consent process:

(1) the purpose of the research, expected duration, and procedures; (2) their right to decline to participate and to withdraw from the research once participation has begun; (3) the foreseeable consequences of declining or withdrawing; (4) reasonably foreseeable factors that may be expected to influence their willingness to participate such as potential risks, discomfort, or adverse effects; (5) any prospective research benefits; (6) limits of confidentiality; (7) incentives for participation; and (8) whom to contact for questions about the research and research participants’ rights. 

Standard 8.02 also states that, when research involves evaluating the effects of experimental treatments, prospective participants must be told about the experimental nature of the treatments, available alternative treatments, the way participants will be assigned to experimental and control groups, and, if appropriate, any treatments or services that will not be provided to participants assigned to the control group. Standard 8.02 does not address research with children and adolescents or others who are legally incapable of giving informed consent, but Standard 3.10(b)’s general requirement for obtaining assent from these individuals applies to their participation in research. In addition, Fisher (2017) points out that U.S. federal regulations (CFR 46.408) permit waiver of a child’s assent to participate in research that involves a therapeutic intervention when (a) the child does not have the capacity to consent or (b) the research offers benefits to the health of the child that cannot be obtained from interventions available outside the research study. In other words, the consent of a child’s legal guardians ordinarily overrides the dissent of the child when the research offers direct health benefits to the child. However, the child’s dissent ordinarily overrides the consent of legal guardians when the research does not offer direct health benefits to the child (Institute of Medicine, 2004). 

Standard 8.05 states that psychologists may dispense with informed consent when doing so is permitted by law or federal or institutional regulations or when the research is not likely to cause distress or harm to subjects and involves (a) studying routine educational practices in educational settings; (b) studying factors related to job or organizational effectiveness in organizational settings when participants’ confidentiality will be maintained and there’s no risk to their employment; or (c) using anonymous questionnaires, naturalistic observations, or archival research when participants’ confidentiality will be maintained and there’s no risk for legal liability or other harm. In addition, Standard 8.03 states that it may be unnecessary to obtain informed consent prior to recording subjects’ voices or images when the study (a) involves naturalistic observations in public places where there’s no expectation of privacy and observations are not likely to cause personal identification or harm or (b) involves deception and consent to use the recording will be obtained during debriefing.

**Inducements for Research Participation:** Providing inducements for participation in a research study is addressed in Standards 8.04 and 8.06. Standard 8.04 applies to situations in which participation is a course requirement or opportunity for extra credit and states that, in this situation, students must be “given the choice of equitable alternative activities.” Standard 8.06 requires psychologists to “make reasonable efforts to avoid offering excessive or inappropriate financial or other inducements for research participation when such inducements are likely to coerce participation.” It allows psychologists to offer professional services in exchange for research participation as long as prospective participants are informed about the nature of the services and potential risks, limitations, and obligations.

**Deception in Research:** The use of deception in research precludes the ability to obtain a truly informed consent from prospective participants. Consequently, as stated in Standard 8.07, deception must be used only when certain conditions are met: It must be “justified by the study’s significant prospective scientific, educational, or applied value” and alternative nondeceptive procedures must be unavailable. Also, participants must (a) not be deceived about procedures that are likely to cause “physical pain or severe emotional distress,” (b) be allowed to withdraw their data from the study at any time, and (c) be informed about the deception “as early as is feasible, preferably at the conclusion of their participation, but no later than at the conclusion of the data collection.”

**Use of Animals in Research:** Standard 8.09 states that the care, use, and disposal of animal subjects must be done in a humane manner and in compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and professional standards. It also states that “psychologists trained in research methods and experienced in the care of laboratory animals supervise all procedures involving animals and are responsible for ensuring appropriate consideration of their comfort, health, and humane treatment” and for ensuring that people “under their supervision who are using animals have received instruction in research methods and in the care, maintenance, and handling of the species being used, to the extent appropriate to their role.” In addition, Standard 8.09 requires psychologists to use procedures that cause animals to experience “pain, stress, or privation only when an alternative procedure is unavailable … [and doing so is justified by the study’s] prospective scientific, educational, or applied value.”  When an animal’s life must be terminated, psychologists must do so rapidly and in a way that minimizes pain and is consistent with accepted procedures. 

**Reporting Research Results and Publication Credit:** Standard 8.10(b) states that, when psychologists “discover significant errors in their published data, they take reasonable steps to correct such errors in a correction, retraction, erratum, or other appropriate publication means.” For example, when psychologists discover an error in their published articles that might affect the ability of readers to accurately interpret the study's results, the psychologists can contact the journal editor to request a published correction (Fisher, 2022). Standard 8.12 requires psychologists to take credit “only for work they have actually performed or to which they have substantially contributed.” It states that “principal authorship and other publication credit [should] accurately reflect the relative scientific or professional contributions of the individuals involved, regardless of their relative status” and that minor contributions “are acknowledged appropriately, such as in footnotes or in an introductory statement.” Standard 8.12 also states that, except in “exceptional circumstances,” students must be listed as the principal author on multiple-authored articles that are substantially based on their doctoral dissertations. Additional guidelines for publication credit are provided in Section 1.21 of the *Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association* (APA, 2020). It states that substantial contributions that warrant authorship include “formulating the problem or hypothesis, structuring the experimental study design, organizing and conducting the analysis, or interpreting the results and findings…. [while] lesser contributions may include such supportive functions as … suggesting or advising about the analysis, collecting or entering the data, … [or] recruiting participants” (Publication Credit section, para. 1). 

**Plagiarism:** Standard 8.11 prohibits psychologists from plagiarizing, which it describes as presenting “portions of another’s work or data as their own, even if the other work or data source is cited occasionally.” As noted by Fisher (2022), plagiarism includes word-for-word replication as well as paraphrasing the work of others without providing appropriate citations. Self-plagiarism is not mentioned in the Ethics Code but is addressed in the *Publication Manual*, which defines it as “presenting one’s own previously published work as original” (Implications of Plagiarism and Self-Plagiarism section, para. 1). Self-plagiarism is generally considered unethical; however, incorporating words used in one’s own previously published work without quotation marks or citation may be acceptable when rewording could lead to inaccuracies and the duplicated information is limited in scope. 

**Duplicate and Piecemeal Publication of Data:** Duplicate publication of data is addressed in Standard 8.13 of the Ethics Code and Section 1.16 of the *Publication Manual*. Standard 8.13 states that “psychologists do not publish, as original data, data that have been previously published” but notes that “this does not preclude republishing data when they are accompanied by proper acknowledgement.” Section 1.16 of the *Publication Manual* distinguishes between duplicate publication and piecemeal (fragmented) publication and notes that a problem with both is that they “misrepresent the amount of original research in the repository of scientific knowledge” (Duplicate and Piecemeal Publication of Data section, para. 1). Section 1.16 defines *duplicate publication* as publishing “the same data or ideas in two separate works” and *piecemeal publication* as “the splitting of the findings from one research effort into multiple works.” It notes that duplicate publication is generally prohibited but that there are exceptions. For example, a manuscript “previously published in abstracted form (e.g., in conference proceedings) or in a periodical with limited circulation or availability … can be published again in a venue of wide circulation” (Examples of and Exceptions to Duplicate Publication section, para. 3). With regard to piecemeal publication, Standard 1.16 states that it is “undesirable unless there is a good reason for it” and that it is “a matter of editorial judgment.” In other words, when submitting a manuscript to a journal, psychologists must inform the journal editor about any previously published or submitted manuscripts that are based on the same data and the extent of the overlap so that the editor can make an informed decision about the acceptability of the new manuscript. 

**Concurrent Submission:** Concurrent (simultaneous) submission of the same article for publication to multiple journals is not addressed in the Ethics Code. However, as noted by Belcher (2019), it is unacceptable for the author of a journal article to simultaneously submit the same article to more than one journal. Instead, the author should submit the article to one journal at a time and wait for it to be rejected by a journal before submitting it to another journal. In addition, submission guidelines for APA journals include the following statement: “APA policy prohibits an author from submitting the same manuscript for concurrent consideration by two or more publications” (APA, 2024).

**Sharing Research Data for Verification:** Standard 8.14 states that, following publication of their research results, psychologists share data from that research with competent professionals who want to reanalyze the data to verify the study’s findings as long as the confidentiality of participants is protected. This requirement implies that psychologists must retain their research data but does not specify the minimum duration of time for doing so. Requirements for retaining research data are provided elsewhere, but the requirements vary: The 6th edition of APA’s (2010) *Publication Manual* states that authors of articles published in an APA journal must maintain raw data for at least five years after publication of the article, and current submission guidelines for APA journals state that “APA expects authors to have their data available throughout the editorial review process and for at least 5 years after the date of publication.” However, the 7th edition of the *Publication Manual* (2020) does not specify a number of years. Instead, it states that “authors are expected to retain the data associated with a published article in accordance with institutional requirements; funder requirements; participant agreements; and, when publishing in an APA journal, the APA Ethics Code” (p. 13). For example, research that involves collecting identifiable health information is subject to HIPAA regulations, which state that records must be retained for at least 6 years after a participant has signed an authorization. [Note that the reference in the 7th edition of the *Publication Manual* to requirements in the APA Ethics Code is unclear because a minimum length of time for retaining research data is not specified in any of the Ethics Code’s Standards.]

**Reviewers:** Standard 8.15 applies to psychologists who review grant applications and papers that have been submitted for publication or presentation at professional meetings. It requires reviewers to treat the content of the documents they review as confidential information and not share the document or any information about it without appropriate permission. For example, when reviewers want to have a colleague or graduate student review a manuscript that has been submitted for publication to a journal, they must first obtain permission to do so from the journal editor (Fisher, 2022). Standard 8.15 also requires reviewers to respect the intellectual property rights of the document’s author(s), which means that reviewers (a) must not make personal or professional use of proprietary and unique ideas, techniques, and information presented in the documents without permission from the author(s) and (b) must not cite or refer to the unpublished manuscript in their own publications. Psychologists should also avoid reviewing documents when there is a conflict of interest (e.g., when a manuscript describes research that supports or contradicts their own research or when the psychologist and manuscript author work at the same institution). Finally, reviewers must return or destroy the documents they have reviewed after their reviews have been submitted to the journal editor, grants program officer, or meeting chair.
