  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Operant conditioning was most extensively developed by which psychologist?",
      "options": [
        "B.F. Skinner",
        "Ivan Pavlov",
        "Albert Bandura",
        "Edward Thorndike"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B.F. Skinner",
      "explanation": "B.F. Skinner is the psychologist most associated with operant conditioning, which focuses on how consequences (reinforcement and punishment) shape behavior. Pavlov worked on classical conditioning, Bandura on social learning, and Thorndike was an early pioneer but Skinner developed it most extensively.",
      "domain": "Domain 1",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "knId": "KN1",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, the zone of proximal development refers to:",
      "options": [
        "The difference between what a child can do alone and what they can do with help from a more skilled person",
        "The specific age range when children develop language abilities",
        "The genetic potential for intellectual development",
        "The cultural practices that determine behavioral norms"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The difference between what a child can do alone and what they can do with help from a more skilled person",
      "explanation": "The zone of proximal development (ZPD) is Vygotsky's concept of the gap between a child's current independent performance level and their potential performance with guidance and support from a more knowledgeable other. This concept emphasizes the social nature of learning.",
      "domain": "Domain 2",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN2",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

      "id": 3,
      "question": "Neuroticism as a personality trait is most closely associated with:",

        "A tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, and irritability",
        "High levels of social dominance and assertiveness",
        "Strong adherence to rules and organization",
        "Openness to new experiences and ideas"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, sadness, and irritability",
      "explanation": "Neuroticism (or emotional instability) in the Big Five personality model is characterized by the tendency to experience negative emotions, emotional distress, and vulnerability. The other options describe different Big Five dimensions: extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness.",
      "domain": "Domain 3",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN3",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of internal validity in research?",
      "options": [
        "The degree to which we can confidently conclude that the independent variable caused the observed effect",
        "The extent to which findings can be generalized to other populations",
        "The consistency of measurement across different observers",
        "The proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the study"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The degree to which we can confidently conclude that the independent variable caused the observed effect",
      "explanation": "Internal validity refers to whether we can draw valid causal conclusions from a study—that is, whether the independent variable actually caused changes in the dependent variable. Option B describes external validity, C relates to inter-rater reliability, and D concerns effect size or R-squared.",
      "domain": "Domain 4",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN4",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that when attitudes and behaviors conflict, people are most likely to:",
      "options": [
        "Change their attitudes to align with their behaviors",
        "Experience psychological discomfort until the inconsistency is resolved",
        "Become defensive and reject contradictory information",
        "Seek social support for their existing beliefs"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Experience psychological discomfort until the inconsistency is resolved",
      "explanation": "According to Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory, when people hold conflicting cognitions (thoughts/attitudes) or when their behavior contradicts their attitudes, they experience psychological tension or discomfort. This motivates them to reduce the dissonance by changing attitudes, behaviors, or adding new thoughts. Option A describes one possible resolution but not the primary prediction of the theory.",
      "domain": "Domain 5",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN5",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "The concept of lateralization in neuroscience refers to:",
      "options": [
        "The specialization of the two brain hemispheres for different functions",
        "The communication between the cortex and subcortical structures",
        "The development of new neurons throughout the lifespan",
        "The protective covering of axons that increases neural transmission speed"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The specialization of the two brain hemispheres for different functions",
      "explanation": "Lateralization describes how different cognitive and motor functions are processed primarily by one hemisphere or the other. For example, language is typically processed in the left hemisphere for most people. Option B describes neural integration, C is neurogenesis, and D describes myelination.",
      "domain": "Domain 6",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN6",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "According to attachment theory, secure attachment in infancy is associated with:",
      "options": [
        "More independent exploration and better social relationships in later life",
        "Reduced anxiety and increased dependency on caregivers",
        "Higher IQ and academic achievement",
        "Decreased empathy and emotional regulation difficulties"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "More independent exploration and better social relationships in later life",
      "explanation": "Bowlby and Ainsworth's research on attachment showed that securely attached infants are more likely to explore their environment confidently and develop positive peer relationships later. Secure attachment doesn't lead to dependency, nor are IQ or empathy directly determined by attachment style.",
      "domain": "Domain 7",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN7",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "In hypothesis testing, a Type II error occurs when:",
      "options": [
        "We fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false",
        "We reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true",
        "We correctly reject the null hypothesis",
        "The p-value is greater than 0.05"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "We fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false",
      "explanation": "A Type II error (false negative) occurs when the null hypothesis is false but we fail to reject it, concluding there is no effect when there actually is one. Option B describes a Type I error, C is a correct conclusion, and D may or may not indicate an error depending on context.",
      "domain": "Domain 8",
      "difficulty": "medium",
