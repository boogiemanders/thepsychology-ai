  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "In behavioral psychology, reinforcement is most accurately defined as:",
      "options": [
        "Any stimulus that increases the likelihood of a behavior occurring again",
        "Punishment designed to decrease unwanted behaviors",
        "A reward given immediately after a behavior",
        "The process of extinguishing conditioned responses"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Any stimulus that increases the likelihood of a behavior occurring again",
      "explanation": "Reinforcement in behavioral psychology refers to any consequence that increases the probability that a behavior will occur again in the future. This includes both positive reinforcement (adding something desirable) and negative reinforcement (removing something aversive). Option B confuses reinforcement with punishment, C is too narrow as reinforcement isn't always immediate, and D refers to extinction.",
      "domain": "Domain 1",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN1",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, which of the following best describes the concrete operational stage?",
      "options": [
        "Children can perform logical operations on concrete objects but struggle with abstract thinking",
        "Infants learn through sensory and motor interactions with the environment",
        "Adolescents develop the ability to think hypothetically and abstractly",
        "Children learn through imitation and the development of language"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Children can perform logical operations on concrete objects but struggle with abstract thinking",
      "explanation": "The concrete operational stage (roughly ages 7-12) is characterized by the ability to think logically about concrete events and objects, but difficulty with abstract or hypothetical thinking. Option B describes the sensorimotor stage, C describes the formal operational stage, and D is more representative of the preoperational stage.",
      "domain": "Domain 2",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN2",
      "isScored": true,

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which neurotransmitter hypothesis is most commonly associated with major depressive disorder?",
      "options": [
        "The monoamine hypothesis",
        "The GABA hypothesis",
        "The glutamate excess hypothesis",
        "The acetylcholine hypothesis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The monoamine hypothesis",
      "explanation": "The monoamine hypothesis suggests that depression results from decreased levels of monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine). This is the biological basis for antidepressant medications like SSRIs. While other neurotransmitter systems may be involved, the monoamine hypothesis remains the most established neurobiological model for MDD.",
      "domain": "Domain 3",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN3",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "In the context of psychological assessment, validity refers to:",
      "options": [
        "The extent to which a test measures what it is intended to measure",
        "The consistency of test scores over time",
        "The degree to which test items are clearly worded",
        "The standardization of test administration procedures"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The extent to which a test measures what it is intended to measure",
      "explanation": "Validity is concerned with whether a test actually measures the construct it claims to measure. Option B describes reliability, C relates to item clarity, and D concerns standardization and administration consistency.",
      "domain": "Domain 4",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "knId": "KN4",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Social identity theory suggests that individuals derive self-esteem partly from:",
      "options": [
        "The status and distinctiveness of groups to which they belong",
        "Their ability to form secure attachments",
        "Their performance on cognitive tasks",
        "Their genetic predispositions"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The status and distinctiveness of groups to which they belong",
      "explanation": "According to Tajfel and Turner's social identity theory, people enhance their self-esteem by promoting the status and positive distinctiveness of groups they identify with. The theory explains in-group bias and favoritism as a means of maintaining positive social identity.",
      "domain": "Domain 5",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN5",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which brain structure is primarily responsible for the regulation of body temperature and hunger?",
      "options": [
        "The hypothalamus",
        "The thalamus",
        "The amygdala",
        "The cerebellum"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The hypothalamus",
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus is a small but crucial brain structure that regulates many homeostatic functions including body temperature, hunger, thirst, and circadian rhythms. The thalamus relays sensory information, the amygdala is involved in emotion, and the cerebellum coordinates movement.",
      "domain": "Domain 6",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "knId": "KN6",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "According to Erikson's psychosocial theory, the primary developmental task of middle adulthood is:",
      "options": [
        "Generativity versus stagnation",
        "Autonomy versus shame and doubt",
        "Identity versus role confusion",
        "Intimacy versus isolation"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Generativity versus stagnation",
      "explanation": "Erikson's stage 7 (middle adulthood, approximately ages 40-64) involves the conflict between generativity (contributing to the next generation, productivity, creativity) and stagnation. The other options represent earlier stages of his theory.",
      "domain": "Domain 7",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "knId": "KN7",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A researcher finds a correlation of r = -0.85 between study time and test anxiety. This indicates:",
      "options": [
        "A strong negative relationship: as study time increases, test anxiety decreases",
        "A weak positive relationship between the variables",
        "That increased study time causes decreased anxiety",
        "That test anxiety has no relationship with academic performance"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A strong negative relationship: as study time increases, test anxiety decreases",
      "explanation": "A correlation of -0.85 indicates a strong negative relationship (the negative sign indicates direction, the 0.85 indicates strength close to 1.0). However, correlation does not imply causation, so option C is incorrect despite the relationship being strong.",
      "domain": "Domain 8",
