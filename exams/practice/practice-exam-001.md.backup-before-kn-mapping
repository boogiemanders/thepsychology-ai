      "question": "The reuptake of neurotransmitters into the presynaptic neuron is primarily blocked by which class of antidepressant medications?",
      "options": [
        "Monoamine oxidase inhibitors",
        "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors",
