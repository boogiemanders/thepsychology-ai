  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between neurotransmitters and synaptic transmission?",
      "options": [
        "Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic neuron and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron",
        "Neurotransmitters travel through the bloodstream to affect distant neurons",
        "Neurotransmitters are produced in the postsynaptic neuron to influence the presynaptic neuron",
        "Neurotransmitters are structural proteins that form synaptic connections"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic neuron and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron",
      "explanation": "In synaptic transmission, neurotransmitters are chemical messengers released from the presynaptic terminal that diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to specific receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, causing either excitation or inhibition.",
      "domain": "Domain 6",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "In the context of classical conditioning, extinction occurs when:",
      "options": [
        "The unconditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without the conditioned stimulus",
        "The conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus",
        "Both the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli are presented together",
        "The organism demonstrates the conditioned response spontaneously"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented without the unconditioned stimulus",
      "explanation": "In classical conditioning, extinction is the weakening and eventual disappearance of a conditioned response when the conditioned stimulus is repeatedly presented alone, without the unconditioned stimulus that originally supported the association.",
      "domain": "Domain 1",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "According to information processing theory, working memory has a capacity of approximately:",
      "options": [
        "7 plus or minus 2 chunks of information",
        "Unlimited capacity but slow processing speed",
        "20 to 30 items maximum",
        "Capacity that increases with age and education"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "7 plus or minus 2 chunks of information",
      "explanation": "Miller's classic research established that working memory can hold approximately 7 ± 2 discrete chunks or units of information at any given time. This capacity is relatively fixed, though the complexity of chunks can vary.",
      "domain": "Domain 2",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which therapeutic approach emphasizes the importance of unconditional positive regard and congruence?",
      "options": [
        "Person-centered therapy developed by Carl Rogers",
        "Cognitive-behavioral therapy developed by Aaron Beck",
        "Psychoanalysis developed by Sigmund Freud",
        "Rational emotive behavior therapy developed by Albert Ellis"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Person-centered therapy developed by Carl Rogers",
      "explanation": "Carl Rogers' person-centered therapy is built on the core conditions of unconditional positive regard (accepting clients without judgment) and congruence (genuineness and authenticity), which Rogers believed were necessary for psychological growth and healing.",
      "domain": "Domain 7",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "In group dynamics, the tendency for groups to make riskier decisions than individuals alone is called:",
      "options": [
        "Risky shift or group polarization",
        "Social loafing",
        "Deindividuation",
        "Groupthink"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Risky shift or group polarization",
      "explanation": "The risky shift phenomenon (also known as group polarization) describes how groups often make more extreme decisions than their individual members would make alone, sometimes resulting in riskier choices. This occurs through discussion and social comparison processes.",
      "domain": "Domain 5",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "Which of the following characterizes the preoperational stage in Piaget's theory?",
      "options": [
        "Egocentrism and difficulty with conservation tasks",
        "The ability to understand object permanence",
        "Formal logical thought and abstract reasoning",
        "Symbolic thought but concrete operational abilities"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Egocentrism and difficulty with conservation tasks",
      "explanation": "The preoperational stage (ages 2-7) is characterized by egocentrism (inability to take another's perspective), centration (focusing on one aspect of a problem), and difficulty with conservation (understanding that quantity doesn't change despite appearance changes).",
      "domain": "Domain 2",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "The diathesis-stress model suggests that psychological disorders result from:",
      "options": [
        "The interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental stressors",
        "Purely genetic factors that are activated during adolescence",
        "Environmental stressors alone without biological predisposition",
        "Learned maladaptive behaviors from early childhood experiences"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental stressors",
      "explanation": "The diathesis-stress model proposes that both a predisposition (diathesis) and environmental stressors interact to produce psychological disorders. Neither factor alone is sufficient; both are necessary for the disorder to manifest.",
      "domain": "Domain 3",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "In psychometric testing, standard deviation is most useful for:",
      "options": [
        "Determining how scores are distributed around the mean",
        "Comparing the means of two different groups",
        "Calculating the correlation between variables",
        "Determining the reliability of a test"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Determining how scores are distributed around the mean",
      "explanation": "Standard deviation measures the spread or variability of scores around the mean. It indicates whether most scores are close to the mean (low standard deviation) or spread out (high standard deviation), helping interpret the distribution of scores.",
      "domain": "Domain 4",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
