      ],
      "correct_answer": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "Rewards are better than predicted",
      "explanation": "Dopamine shows reward prediction error coding: firing increases when outcomes exceed predictions and decreases when outcomes are worse than expected. This supports learning through prediction adjustment.",
