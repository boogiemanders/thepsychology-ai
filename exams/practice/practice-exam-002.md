  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "In attribution theory, the fundamental attribution error refers to:",
      "options": [
        "The tendency to overestimate internal factors and underestimate external factors when explaining others' behavior",
        "The tendency to make more internal attributions for our own failures",
        "The inability to predict behavior from personality traits",
        "Systematic errors in statistical analysis of behavioral data"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The tendency to overestimate internal factors and underestimate external factors when explaining others' behavior",
      "explanation": "The fundamental attribution error (also called correspondence bias) is the tendency for observers to attribute others' behavior to internal factors (personality, ability) while downplaying situational factors. We tend to reverse this bias for ourselves, a phenomenon known as the actor-observer bias.",
      "domain": "Domain 5",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "According to signal detection theory, a 'false alarm' occurs when:",
      "options": [
        "A signal is present and the observer detects it",
        "A signal is absent but the observer reports detecting it",
        "A signal is present but the observer fails to detect it",
        "A signal is absent and the observer correctly reports its absence"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A signal is absent but the observer reports detecting it",
      "explanation": "In signal detection theory, there are four possible outcomes: hits (signal present, detected), misses (signal present, not detected), false alarms (signal absent, reported present), and correct rejections (signal absent, correctly identified as absent).",
      "domain": "Domain 2",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "Which brain structure is most directly involved in the consolidation of declarative memories?",
      "options": [
        "The hippocampus",
        "The cerebellum",
        "The amygdala",
        "The basal ganglia"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The hippocampus",
      "explanation": "The hippocampus plays a critical role in converting short-term memories into long-term declarative (explicit) memories. The cerebellum is involved in procedural memory, the amygdala in emotional memory, and the basal ganglia in habit formation.",
      "domain": "Domain 6",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "In test-retest reliability, scores on two administrations of the same test are correlated. A correlation of +0.82 would indicate:",
      "options": [
        "Good test-retest reliability; the test produces consistent scores over time",
        "Poor test-retest reliability; substantial change in performance between administrations",
        "The test measures what it claims to measure",
        "High internal consistency among test items"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Good test-retest reliability; the test produces consistent scores over time",
      "explanation": "A correlation of +0.82 between test administrations indicates strong positive relationship and good test-retest reliability. The test shows consistency—those who score high on the first administration tend to score high on the second, and vice versa.",
      "domain": "Domain 4",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the purpose of systematic desensitization?",
      "options": [
        "To gradually reduce conditioned fear responses by pairing the feared stimulus with relaxation",
        "To rapidly expose clients to their feared stimuli without escape",
        "To modify maladaptive thought patterns through cognitive restructuring",
        "To increase awareness of unconscious motivations and conflicts"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "To gradually reduce conditioned fear responses by pairing the feared stimulus with relaxation",
      "explanation": "Systematic desensitization, developed by Joseph Wolpe, is a behavioral technique based on reciprocal inhibition. The feared stimulus is gradually introduced while the client is in a relaxed state, so relaxation becomes the conditioned response instead of fear.",
      "domain": "Domain 7",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "In the context of lifespan development, the concept of plasticity refers to:",
      "options": [
        "The capacity of the developing organism to be shaped by environmental influences",
        "The fixed genetic blueprint that determines development",
        "The progressive loss of neural connections with aging",
        "The stage-specific nature of developmental transitions"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The capacity of the developing organism to be shaped by environmental influences",
      "explanation": "Plasticity in developmental psychology describes the flexibility and adaptability of developing systems to environmental influences. High plasticity means development is not strictly predetermined but can be shaped by experience, particularly early in life.",
      "domain": "Domain 2",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of Major Depressive Disorder according to DSM-5 criteria?",
      "options": [
        "A depressed mood or loss of interest in activities present for at least two weeks",
        "Persistent feelings of worthlessness present for at least one week",
        "Mood symptoms that are exclusively situational",
        "The presence of psychotic symptoms in the absence of mood disturbance"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A depressed mood or loss of interest in activities present for at least two weeks",
      "explanation": "DSM-5 criteria for MDD require either depressed mood or anhedonia (loss of interest/pleasure) present for at least two weeks, plus additional symptoms. The duration and the presence of clinical significance are key diagnostic features.",
      "domain": "Domain 3",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "In classical conditioning, spontaneous recovery refers to:",
      "options": [
        "The reappearance of an extinguished conditioned response after a rest period",
        "The strengthening of a response through repeated pairings",
        "The weakening of a response due to repetition without reinforcement",
        "The transfer of a conditioned response to similar stimuli"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "The reappearance of an extinguished conditioned response after a rest period",
      "explanation": "Spontaneous recovery is the phenomenon where a conditioned response that had been extinguished reappears after a rest or delay period, suggesting that extinction doesn't erase the original association but rather inhibits it.",
      "domain": "Domain 1",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "isScored": true,
      "type": "standard"
