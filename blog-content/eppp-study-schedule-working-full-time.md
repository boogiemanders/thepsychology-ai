# How to Study for the EPPP While Working Full-Time

When I was preparing for the EPPP, I was working full-time as a postdoc. I had maybe 6 good study hours a week, if I skipped everything else. The standard advice of "15-20 hours per week" felt like a cruel joke.

I remember reading one study guide that casually suggested waking up at 5 AM for a two-hour study block, then doing another two hours after work, plus four hours each weekend day. That's 18 hours a week. The person who wrote that clearly didn't have a full caseload, treatment plans due by Friday, and supervision notes to write. They probably didn't fall asleep on the couch at 8:30 PM on a Tuesday either.

If you're reading this while exhausted after a full day of clinical work, wondering how you're supposed to pass a 225-question licensing exam on top of everything else, I wrote this for you. Because I was you.

## The Myth of 15-20 Hours Per Week

Most EPPP study guides are written as if you're a full-time student with nothing else going on. They assume you can carve out large blocks of uninterrupted study time, that your weekends are free, and that your brain isn't already fried from eight hours of clinical work.

Here's the reality for most postdocs:

- **Full-time clinical work:** 8-10 hours per day, often emotionally demanding
- **Supervision meetings:** 1-2 hours per week minimum
- **Documentation:** treatment plans, progress notes, case conceptualizations
- **Commuting:** 30-60 minutes each way for many people
- **Life:** partners, kids, groceries, laundry, the fact that you haven't called your parents in two weeks

When you add all of that up, telling someone to find 15-20 hours per week for studying is not just unrealistic. It's demoralizing. You try it for a week, can't sustain it, and then feel like you're already failing before you've started.

Here's what I want you to hear: **15-20 hours per week is not necessary if you study smart.** The research on learning science backs this up. It's not about volume. It's about what you do with the time you have.

## The Realistic Schedule: 6-8 Hours Per Week

I passed the EPPP studying roughly 6-8 hours per week over about six months. That's it. No heroic 4 AM wake-ups. No sacrificing every weekend. No burnout spiral three weeks before the exam.

The key insight is simple: **6-8 focused hours using active recall and adaptive prioritization will outperform 15 hours of passive reading every single time.**

This isn't just my opinion. Decades of cognitive psychology research (the same material you probably studied in grad school) shows that:

- Active recall (testing yourself) produces 2-3x better retention than re-reading
- Spaced repetition locks information into long-term memory with less total study time
- Studying the right material at the right time (targeting your weak areas) means you're not wasting hours reviewing content you already know

The math works out. If every hour of your studying is high-yield, you need fewer hours total.

## Finding Study Time: 5 Strategies That Actually Work

The biggest obstacle isn't motivation. It's logistics. Where do these 6-8 hours come from when your day is already full? Here are the five time slots I used, and that I've seen work for hundreds of postdocs since.

### 1. The Morning Block (30-45 Minutes Before Work)

This was the single most important habit I built. Before checking email, before looking at my phone, before doing anything else, I'd sit down with a cup of coffee and study for 30-45 minutes.

Your brain is fresh in the morning. You haven't spent your cognitive energy on clients yet. Even 30 minutes of focused active recall before work is worth more than an hour of reading at 9 PM when you can barely keep your eyes open.

**Practical tip:** Set out your study materials the night before. Open the app on your phone or laptop so it's the first thing you see. Remove every friction point between waking up and starting.

### 2. Lunch Break Sessions (15-20 Minutes)

You probably get some kind of break between clients. Even 15 minutes of quizzing yourself during lunch adds up fast. That's 75 minutes per week from time that would otherwise go to scrolling your phone or staring at the break room wall.

You don't need a quiet library for this. A quiz on your phone at your desk works. The point isn't perfection. It's repetition.

### 3. Commute Audio (Variable)

If you drive or take public transit, your commute is dead time that can become study time. Listening to a lesson on a study topic while driving isn't as effective as active recall, but it serves as solid initial exposure to material before you quiz yourself on it later.

Even 15-20 minutes of audio each way adds 2.5-3 hours of passive exposure per week. That's not nothing.

### 4. Evening Micro-Sessions (15-20 Minutes)

I'm not going to tell you to study for two hours after work. After a full day of clinical work, that's a recipe for resentment and burnout. But 15-20 minutes? One quick quiz session after dinner, or after the kids are in bed? That's doable for most people most days.

The key word is "most." If you had a brutal day, skip it. One missed evening session doesn't matter. Consistency over weeks matters.

### 5. Weekend Focused Block (60-90 Minutes)

Pick one day, Saturday or Sunday, and block out 60-90 minutes for a deeper study session. This is where you tackle harder material, work through practice questions on your weakest domains, and do the kind of concentrated work that's difficult during the week.

One block. Not four hours. Not your entire Saturday. One focused block, and then you're done for the day.

### Sample Weekly Breakdown

Here's what a realistic week looks like:

| Day | Study Activity | Time |
|-----|---------------|------|
| Monday | 30 min morning block + 15 min lunch quiz | 45 min |
| Tuesday | 30 min morning block + 15 min lunch quiz | 45 min |
| Wednesday | 30 min morning block + 15 min lunch quiz | 45 min |
| Thursday | 30 min morning block + 15 min lunch quiz | 45 min |
| Friday | 30 min morning block + 15 min lunch quiz | 45 min |
| Saturday | 90 min focused study session | 90 min |
| Sunday | 45 min review + quiz session | 45 min |
| **Total** | | **~6 hours** |

Some weeks you'll hit closer to 8 hours. Some weeks, life happens and you'll get 4. That's fine. The goal is a sustainable average, not a rigid daily quota.

## The Efficiency Multipliers

Studying 6-8 hours a week only works if those hours are high-yield. Here's how to make every minute count.

### Active Recall Over Passive Reading

Stop re-reading textbooks. I know it feels productive. It isn't. The research is unambiguous: testing yourself on material, even before you feel "ready," produces dramatically better retention than re-reading or highlighting.

Every study session should involve answering questions. If you just read a chapter, quiz yourself on it immediately. If you're reviewing a domain, do it through practice questions, not by re-reading your notes.

### Adaptive Prioritization

This is where most self-study plans waste enormous amounts of time. If you're scoring 85% on Biological Bases of Behavior but only 45% on Research Methods, those two domains should not get equal study time. Not even close.

Focus your limited hours on the domains where improvement will actually move your overall score. An hour spent improving a weak domain from 45% to 60% is worth far more than an hour pushing a strong domain from 85% to 90%.

### Spaced Retrieval

When you learn new material, quiz yourself on it within 24 hours. Then again in 3 days. Then again in a week. This spaced retrieval schedule is one of the most robust findings in all of learning science, and it means you retain more while studying less.

If you study a topic on Monday morning, do a quick quiz on it during your Tuesday lunch break. That single retrieval attempt will do more for your long-term retention than re-reading the material three times in one sitting.

### Interleaving

Don't spend three weeks studying only one domain. Mix topics across your study sessions. Monday morning might be Ethics questions, Monday lunch might be a few Social Psychology items, and your Tuesday morning block might cover Assessment.

Interleaving feels harder in the moment, and that's exactly why it works. The difficulty of switching between topics strengthens the retrieval pathways in your brain. It also better mimics the actual EPPP, where questions from all domains are mixed together.

## What to Cut (Without Guilt)

When you're working full-time, studying for the EPPP means something else isn't getting done. Here's what you can let go of.

### Perfectionism

You need to pass, not get a perfect score. The EPPP is pass/fail. Nobody will ever ask what your score was. If you're spending hours trying to master obscure subtopics in a domain you're already strong in, that's time stolen from domains where you actually need improvement.

A passing score is typically around 500 (on the scaled score), which corresponds to roughly 65-70% correct. You don't need to know everything. You need to know enough.

### Low-Yield Studying

If you've taken a practice exam and scored 80%+ on a domain, give yourself permission to mostly stop studying it. Do a brief review quiz every couple of weeks to maintain your knowledge, and redirect those hours to your 50-60% domains.

This feels wrong. Your brain wants to study the stuff you're already good at because it feels rewarding. Resist that impulse. Your weak domains are where the points are.

### Social Media Doom-Scrolling

I'm not going to lecture you about screen time. But here's a practical trade: the next time you catch yourself 15 minutes deep into scrolling, switch to a quick quiz instead. Same phone, same couch, same amount of effort, but one of those activities moves you closer to your license and the other doesn't.

You don't have to delete your apps. Just notice the scrolling and redirect it when you can.

## Protecting Your Mental Health While Studying and Working

This section matters more than any study technique I've described. If you burn out, nothing else in this article helps.

### You're at Higher Risk for Burnout

Full-time clinical work is already emotionally demanding. Adding exam preparation on top of it creates a sustained cognitive load that can grind you down over weeks and months. The people who fail the EPPP while working full-time usually don't fail because they're not smart enough. They fail because they pushed too hard, burned out, and either took the exam exhausted or stopped studying entirely.

### Take One Full Day Off Per Week

Pick one day where you do zero EPPP studying. None. Not even "just a quick quiz." Your brain needs genuine recovery to consolidate what you've learned. Rest is part of the study plan, not a break from it.

### Sleep Is Non-Negotiable

If you're sleeping less than 7 hours to create more study time, you're actively sabotaging yourself. Sleep is when your brain consolidates memories and strengthens the neural pathways you built during studying. Six hours of sleep and an extra hour of studying will produce worse results than seven hours of sleep and no extra studying.

I know this is hard to hear when you're desperate for more hours in the day. But the cognitive science on this is rock solid. Protect your sleep.

### Use Evidence-Based Recovery Techniques

You're a psychologist (or about to be one). Use your training on yourself. ACT-based defusion techniques are helpful when exam anxiety spikes. Brief mindfulness exercises between clients can reduce cognitive fatigue. Motivational interviewing principles, particularly the idea of working with ambivalence rather than against it, can help on days when you don't want to study at all.

### Remember What You're Actually Doing

You're studying for a high-stakes licensing exam while simultaneously working full-time in a demanding clinical role. That is objectively hard. If you're falling behind your study schedule, you're not lazy. If you need to take a week off from studying, you're not weak. You're doing something difficult under difficult conditions, and the fact that you're still showing up matters.

## When to Take the Exam

### Consider the 6-Month Plan

If you're working full-time, I strongly recommend planning for a 6-month study timeline rather than 3 months. A 3-month timeline at 6-8 hours per week gives you roughly 100-130 total study hours. A 6-month timeline gives you 150-200+ hours, with much less weekly pressure.

The extra time also gives you a buffer for the inevitable weeks when work gets hectic, you get sick, or life throws something unexpected at you. With a 3-month plan, one bad week can throw off your entire schedule. With 6 months, you can absorb disruptions without panic.

### Don't Rush Because of External Pressure

"You should have taken it already." "My cohort-mate passed it in two months." "Just get it over with."

Ignore all of this. The only timeline that matters is the one that gets you to a passing score without destroying your mental health. If that takes 4 months, great. If it takes 8 months, also great. You're not in competition with anyone. You're working toward your license at a pace that's sustainable for your life.

### Schedule Strategically

Don't schedule your exam during your busiest work period. Avoid weeks when you have evaluations due, heavy clinical loads, or administrative deadlines. Pick a window when work is relatively stable so you can protect your cognitive energy in the final weeks of preparation.

If possible, take 2-3 days off work before the exam, not to cram, but to rest and do light review. You want to walk into the testing center rested, not running on fumes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does it take to pass the EPPP while working full-time?**
Most people working full-time and studying 6-8 hours per week should plan for 4-6 months. Some pass in less time, especially if they have strong foundational knowledge from their doctoral program. Others need 7-8 months, and there's nothing wrong with that.

**What if I can only study 4-5 hours per week?**
That's still workable. Just extend your timeline to 7-8 months. The key is consistency and using active recall methods. Four focused hours per week over 8 months (roughly 130+ hours total) is enough for many people.

**Should I study before or after work?**
Before, if at all possible. Your cognitive resources are depleted after a full day of clinical work. Morning study sessions are consistently more productive per minute than evening sessions. But if mornings genuinely don't work for your schedule, evenings are still better than not studying.

**How do I handle weeks when work is overwhelming?**
Scale back to maintenance mode: one 15-minute quiz per day, just to keep the material fresh. Don't try to power through a full study schedule during your worst weeks. It's better to do a little and sustain the habit than to do nothing and lose momentum.

**Is it okay to study on my phone?**
Absolutely. Some of my most productive study sessions happened on my phone during lunch breaks or while waiting for supervision. The best study session is the one you actually do, regardless of the device.

**What if I've already failed the EPPP once?**
A first attempt that doesn't go your way gives you incredibly valuable data: you now know exactly which domains need the most work. Many people pass on their second attempt with fewer total study hours because they can target their preparation much more precisely. A failed attempt is not a reflection of your ability. It's information.
