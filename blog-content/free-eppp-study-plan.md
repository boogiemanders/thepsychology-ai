# Free EPPP Study Plan: 3-Month and 6-Month Templates

The most common question I get: "How long should I study for the EPPP?" The honest answer: it depends. Your background, how recently you finished your program, which domains you already feel solid on, all of it matters. But after working with hundreds of candidates, I can give you two proven templates that work. One is a 3-month intensive plan for people who can dedicate real time each week. The other is a 6-month plan built for people working full-time. Both follow the same underlying logic, and both are free to use starting right now.

Print this out. Pin it to your wall. Follow it week by week. You don't need to sign up for anything.

## How Long Should You Actually Study for the EPPP?

The conventional advice is 15-20 hours per week for 3-6 months. You'll see that number repeated on every forum, in every study group, from every prep company. And it's not wrong. If you're doing unfocused reading of a 1,200-page textbook, you probably do need that many hours.

But here's what I've seen over and over again: **6-10 hours per week of targeted studying can be more effective than 15 hours of unfocused reading.** The difference is strategy. Rereading a chapter on Social Psychology when you already scored 78% on that domain is a waste of your limited study time. Spending that same hour drilling Biological Bases content you scored 45% on moves your overall score significantly more.

The total hours matter less than where you spend them. Both plans below are built on that principle: identify your weakest areas first, spend disproportionate time there, and quiz frequently to confirm you're actually retaining material.

Here are the realistic time commitments:

- **3-month plan:** 8-10 hours per week (about 1.5 hours per day, with one rest day)
- **6-month plan:** 5-7 hours per week (about 45-60 minutes per day, with two rest days)

Most candidates who pass the EPPP log between 150-300 total study hours. Both plans land you squarely in that range.

## Before You Start: Take a Diagnostic

Do not build a study plan without knowing where you stand. This is the single biggest mistake I see candidates make: they start on page one of a review book and read linearly. That approach treats every domain as equally important for *you*, and it's almost never true.

A baseline diagnostic across all 8 EPPP content domains tells you three things:

1. **Which domains need the most work**, which is where you'll get the highest return on study time
2. **Which domains you can review lightly**, so you don't over-study what you already know
3. **Your starting point**, so you can measure actual progress, not just "feeling" more prepared

You can use any full-length EPPP practice exam as your diagnostic. The key is that it covers all 8 domains and gives you a domain-level score breakdown, not just a total score. Take it under timed conditions (4 hours, 225 questions) to simulate the real exam environment.

Record your domain scores. You'll use these to prioritize the study plans below.

**Your 8 EPPP content domains:**

1. Biological Bases of Behavior
2. Cognitive-Affective Bases of Behavior
3. Social and Multicultural Bases of Behavior
4. Growth and Lifespan Development
5. Assessment and Diagnosis
6. Treatment/Intervention
7. Research Methods and Statistics
8. Ethical/Legal/Professional Issues

## The 3-Month EPPP Study Plan

This plan is for candidates who can commit 8-10 hours per week. It works well if you have a set exam date 12 weeks out, if you're between jobs, or if you can carve out dedicated study blocks during your day.

### Week 1: Full Diagnostic + Score Review

- Take a full-length practice exam (225 questions, timed at 4 hours)
- Score it and record your domain-level results
- Rank your 8 domains from weakest to strongest
- Group them into three tiers: Weakest 3, Middle 3, Strongest 2

**Time commitment this week:** 6-8 hours (4 for the exam, 2-4 for review)

### Weeks 2-4: Your 3 Weakest Domains

These are your highest-yield weeks. Every hour here moves your score more than any hour later in the plan.

- **Daily structure (Mon-Sat, ~1.5 hours/day):**
  - 30 minutes: Study new content in one domain
  - 15 minutes: Quiz yourself on what you just studied (10-15 questions)
  - 15 minutes: Review quiz answers, focusing on *why* you got items wrong
  - 15 minutes: Quick review of content from the previous day
  - 15 minutes: Mixed-domain quiz from any weak domain studied so far

- Rotate through your 3 weakest domains: one domain per day, cycling through
- At the end of Week 4, take a 75-question mini-exam covering only these 3 domains
- Compare scores to your diagnostic baseline

**Target:** Improve each of these 3 domains by at least 10-15 percentage points from baseline.

### Weeks 5-7: Your Next 3 Domains

Same daily structure. These domains need less intensive work since they were mid-range on your diagnostic, but they still need attention.

- Continue rotating: one domain per day across your 3 middle-tier domains
- At the end of Week 7, take a 75-question mini-exam covering these 3 domains
- Also take a 30-question refresher quiz on your original 3 weakest domains to check retention

**Target:** Move each of these domains to 70%+ accuracy.

### Weeks 8-9: Your 2 Strongest Domains + Review

- Spend 3-4 days per week on your 2 strongest domains (lighter review, targeted quizzing)
- Spend 2-3 days per week circling back to any domain still below 65%
- Focus on high-frequency topic areas within each domain rather than trying to cover every detail

### Weeks 10-11: Full Practice Exams + Targeted Review

- **Week 10:** Take a full practice exam. Review every wrong answer. Identify your remaining weak spots by domain and by topic within each domain.
- **Week 11:** Take a second full practice exam. Focus all remaining study time on the specific topics you keep getting wrong.

**What to do with practice exam results:**
- Any domain below 65%: add 2 extra study sessions that week for that domain
- Any domain above 80%: skip it in review, reallocate that time to weaker areas
- Track which *types* of questions you miss (application vs. recall vs. analysis)

### Week 12: Light Review + Exam Day Prep

- **Monday-Wednesday:** Light review only. Flashcards, quick quizzes, skim notes on your 2-3 weakest areas. No new material.
- **Thursday:** 30-minute review session, then stop studying.
- **Friday (if exam is Saturday):** No studying. Exercise, sleep well, prep your exam-day logistics (directions, ID, confirmation number).
- **Exam day:** Light breakfast, arrive early, trust your preparation.

Do not cram this week. You will not learn meaningful new content in 7 days. Your job this week is to stay sharp and stay calm.

## The 6-Month EPPP Study Plan

This plan is for candidates who are working full-time, completing postdoc hours, or have other significant time constraints. The pace is slower, but the total study hours end up in the same 150-250 range.

### Month 1: Diagnostic + 2 Weakest Domains

- **Week 1:** Take your diagnostic exam on a weekend when you can block 4-5 hours. Score it, rank your domains, plan your order of attack.
- **Weeks 2-4:** Focus exclusively on your 2 lowest-scoring domains.

**Daily structure (Mon-Fri, ~45-60 min/day):**
- 25 minutes: Study content in one domain
- 15 minutes: Quiz (10 questions on today's material)
- 10 minutes: Review yesterday's material via flashcards or a short quiz
- **Weekend:** One 45-minute study session + one 20-question practice quiz

Alternate domains every other day. At the end of Month 1, take a 50-question quiz on these 2 domains.

### Month 2: Next 2 Domains

- Same daily structure as Month 1
- Focus on domains ranked 3rd and 4th weakest
- One weekend session per week should include a 15-question refresher on Month 1 domains
- End-of-month: 50-question quiz on these 2 domains

### Month 3: Next 2 Domains

- Same structure
- Focus on domains ranked 5th and 6th
- Weekend refresher quizzes now rotate through all previously studied domains
- End-of-month: 50-question quiz on these 2 domains

### Month 4: Final 2 Domains + First Full Practice Exam

- **Weeks 1-2:** Study your 2 strongest domains. Since these are already your best areas, you can reduce daily study time to 30-40 minutes and focus on filling specific gaps.
- **Week 3:** Take your first full practice exam (225 questions, timed). Score it and do a thorough domain-by-domain review.
- **Week 4:** Analyze your practice exam results. Identify your 3-4 weakest domains and note the specific topics within each domain where you lost the most points.

### Month 5: Targeted Review + Second Practice Exam

- **Weeks 1-2:** Focus all study time on the domains and topics flagged from your practice exam. Go deep on the specific content you're missing rather than re-reviewing entire domains.
- **Week 3:** Take a second full practice exam.
- **Week 4:** Compare results to your first practice exam. You should see measurable improvement. If any domain is still below 60%, that domain gets priority for Month 6.

**How to fit this around a full-time schedule:**
- Study at the same time every day (before work, during lunch, or right after work, pick one and make it a habit)
- Keep your study materials accessible on your phone for 5-minute review sessions during downtime
- Protect your study time like you would a client appointment. It's non-negotiable
- If you miss a day, don't double up the next day. Just pick up where you left off.

### Month 6: Final Review + Practice Exam + Exam Prep

- **Weeks 1-2:** Targeted review of remaining weak areas. Focus on high-frequency topics and content you keep getting wrong on quizzes.
- **Week 3:** Take your final full practice exam. This is your dress rehearsal.
- **Week 4:** Light review only. Follow the same Week 12 protocol from the 3-month plan: taper down, no new material, rest before exam day.

## Domain Priority Order by Typical Exam Weight

Not all domains carry equal weight on the EPPP. While ASPPB doesn't publish exact percentages, analysis of practice exams and candidate reports gives us a reliable picture. Here's how to prioritize:

| Priority | Domain | Approx. Weight | Typical Difficulty to Improve |
|----------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Treatment/Intervention | ~16% | Moderate |
| 2 | Assessment and Diagnosis | ~14% | Easier: high memorization, responds well to drilling |
| 3 | Ethical/Legal/Professional Issues | ~14% | Easier: rule-based, responds well to practice questions |
| 4 | Biological Bases of Behavior | ~13% | Harder: requires foundational knowledge of neuroanatomy |
| 5 | Cognitive-Affective Bases | ~12% | Moderate |
| 6 | Growth and Lifespan Development | ~11% | Moderate |
| 7 | Social and Multicultural Bases | ~10% | Moderate |
| 8 | Research Methods and Statistics | ~10% | Harder: requires comfort with statistical concepts |

**Key takeaway:** If you're weak in Treatment, Assessment, or Ethics, fix those first. They carry the most weight *and* they're among the most responsive to focused study. If you're weak in Biological Bases or Research/Stats, budget extra time, because those domains improve more slowly.

Use this table to break ties when your diagnostic scores are close. If two domains scored equally low, prioritize the one with higher exam weight.

## Weekly Study Session Template

Here's a plug-and-play weekly template. Adjust the specific times, but keep the pattern: study, quiz, study, quiz, rest, review.

| Day | Activity | Time |
|-----|----------|------|
| **Monday** | Study new material in Domain A | 30 min |
| **Tuesday** | Quiz on Monday's material (10-15 questions) + review wrong answers | 20 min |
| **Wednesday** | Study new material in Domain B | 30 min |
| **Thursday** | Mixed quiz: questions from Domains A and B + any previous domains | 20 min |
| **Friday** | Rest day. No studying. Go for a walk, exercise, do something unrelated. | 0 min |
| **Saturday** | Study session: review notes from the week or tackle a new sub-topic | 45 min |
| **Sunday** | Practice quiz: 20-25 mixed-domain questions | 25 min |

**Total: approximately 2 hours 50 minutes per week** (minimum). Scale up by adding 15-30 minutes to each session if you're on the 3-month plan.

A few notes on this template:

- **Friday rest is intentional.** Spaced repetition research consistently shows that rest periods between study sessions improve long-term retention. Taking Friday off means your Saturday session benefits from consolidation that happened overnight.
- **Mixed quizzes on Thursday and Sunday are critical.** Single-domain quizzes test recall. Mixed-domain quizzes test the ability to distinguish between similar concepts across domains, which is exactly what the EPPP tests.
- **Adjust every 2 weeks.** If Domain A scores are climbing but Domain B is flat, swap more time to Domain B the following week. The plan should evolve as your scores change.

## Tips for Sticking to the Plan

A study plan only works if you follow it. Here's what actually helps candidates stay consistent:

**Use a timer.** Set a 25-minute timer (Pomodoro technique) for study sessions. When it goes off, take a 5-minute break. This prevents the "I'll study for 2 hours" sessions that turn into 45 minutes of reading and 75 minutes of checking your phone. Short, focused blocks beat long, distracted ones.

**Study at the same time each day.** Habit formation research is clear: consistency of cue (same time, same place) reduces the willpower needed to start. If you study at 6:30 AM every morning, it stops being a decision and starts being a routine within 2-3 weeks.

**Quiz yourself after every session.** Never end a study session without answering at least 5-10 questions on what you just reviewed. If you can't answer questions on it, you didn't learn it. You just read it. There's a measurable difference between recognition ("that looks familiar") and recall ("I can explain this"), and only recall predicts exam performance.

**Track your scores.** Keep a simple spreadsheet or notebook with your quiz scores by domain and by date. Seeing a domain score go from 48% to 62% to 71% is motivating in a way that "I studied hard this week" is not. Numbers don't lie.

**Take breaks when you feel diminishing returns.** If you've been staring at the same page for 10 minutes without retaining anything, stop. Get up, move around, come back later or switch to a different domain. Grinding through mental fatigue does not produce learning. It produces frustration and the illusion of progress.

**Adjust the plan every 2 weeks.** Your study plan is a starting point, not a fixed contract. Every 2 weeks, look at your quiz scores. Ask: "Which domains improved? Which didn't? Where should I spend more time next?" Then update your weekly schedule accordingly. The candidates who pass are the ones who adapt, not the ones who rigidly follow a plan that isn't working.

**Find an accountability partner.** If possible, study with someone or check in weekly with a colleague who's also preparing. A 5-minute text exchange ("I scored 70% on Assessment this week, up from 63%") adds just enough social accountability to keep you on track.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many practice exams should I take before the real EPPP?

At minimum, 2-3 full-length practice exams. The 3-month plan includes 2 full exams plus mini-exams. The 6-month plan includes 3 full exams. Each one serves a different purpose: the first establishes your baseline after studying, the second measures improvement, and the third is your final dress rehearsal. Don't take more than 4-5 total, or you'll start memorizing specific questions rather than learning the material.

### What score should I aim for on practice exams?

The EPPP passing score is a scaled 500 (roughly 65-70% correct, depending on the difficulty calibration). Aim for 70-75% on practice exams as your target. Practice exams tend to be slightly harder or slightly easier than the real thing depending on the source, so a 5-point buffer gives you margin.

### Should I use one study resource or multiple?

Use one primary resource for content review and supplement with a second source for practice questions. Jumping between 4-5 different prep books creates the feeling of studying without the depth of actually learning material. Pick one, go through it systematically, and use a separate question bank for quizzing.

### What if I'm scoring below 50% on my diagnostic?

That's normal, especially if you finished your program more than a year ago. A low diagnostic score doesn't mean you need to study longer. It means the study plan matters even more. Follow the plans above, starting with your weakest domains, and track your improvement. Most candidates who start in the 40-50% range reach passing scores within the timeframes outlined here.

### Is the 3-month plan or 6-month plan better?

Neither is inherently better. The 3-month plan works if you can dedicate 8-10 focused hours per week and want to get the exam behind you. The 6-month plan works if you're balancing work and other responsibilities and need a sustainable pace. The total study hours are similar. Pick the plan that matches your life right now, not the one that sounds more impressive.

### When should I schedule my exam?

Schedule it before you start studying. Having a fixed exam date creates urgency and prevents the "I'll take it when I feel ready" trap, which often leads to indefinite postponement. Pick a date that aligns with either the 3-month or 6-month plan and work backward from there.

### What should I do the day before the exam?

Nothing intense. Light review of flashcards if you feel like it. Lay out everything you need for exam day (ID, confirmation, directions). Exercise. Eat a normal dinner. Go to bed at your usual time. The worst thing you can do the night before is stay up late cramming material you should have studied weeks ago.

## Start Your Plan Today

Both of these plans follow the same principle: diagnose your gaps, prioritize high-yield domains, and quiz frequently. The candidates who pass the EPPP aren't the ones who study the most hours. They're the ones who study the right material at the right time and verify their learning through consistent self-testing.

You now have everything you need to build a study schedule and follow it. Pick the plan that fits your timeline, take your diagnostic, and start Week 1.
