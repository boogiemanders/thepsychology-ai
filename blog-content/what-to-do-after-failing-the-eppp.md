# What to Do After Failing the EPPP: A Recovery Plan

If you just failed the EPPP, you probably don't want to hear "it'll be okay." So I won't start there.

I'll start with the truth: this is devastating. You spent months studying. You spent hundreds, maybe thousands, of dollars on prep materials, registration fees, and the exam itself. You walked into that testing center having sacrificed weekends, relationships, sleep. And the result was not what you worked for.

The shame hits first. Then the anger. Then the spiraling questions: *What's wrong with me? Am I actually cut out for this? How am I going to tell people? How am I going to afford to retake this? What if I fail again?*

I know those questions because I've sat with them myself. The first time I took a full-length practice exam for the EPPP, I scored 19%. Nineteen percent. I stared at that number and genuinely considered whether I had made a mistake choosing this career. That fear, the one sitting in your chest right now, I've felt it.

This article is the one I wish someone had handed me during that period. Not a pep talk. Not a sales pitch. A plan.

## You Are Not Alone

Let's get one thing straight: you are not uniquely broken.

The EPPP has roughly a 24% fail rate on the first attempt. That's nearly 1 in 4 candidates. In some years and some jurisdictions, it's higher. These are people who completed doctoral programs, survived internships, passed dissertations. They are not stupid. They are not incompetent. They failed one exam on one day.

The exam is designed to be difficult. It covers an enormous breadth of content, from biological bases of behavior to industrial-organizational psychology, and it tests the kind of nuanced application-level thinking that doesn't always correlate with how good you are at actual clinical work. Plenty of excellent therapists, researchers, and clinicians have failed this exam. Some of them are now your supervisors, your professors, your colleagues. Most of them just don't talk about it.

The silence around EPPP failure is part of what makes it so isolating. Psychology as a profession talks constantly about vulnerability and destigmatizing failure, and then collectively pretends that everyone passes their licensing exam on the first try. That hypocrisy makes this harder than it needs to be.

So here's the reality: you failed. It happened. It does not define your clinical abilities, your intelligence, or your future. But it does mean you need a different plan going forward. Let's build one.

## The Practical Steps (In Order)

When everything feels overwhelming, order helps. Here's what to do, step by step.

### Step 1: Take a Real Break

Not a long one. But a real one.

Give yourself 1 to 2 weeks where you do not open a textbook, do not look at practice questions, and do not read forums about the EPPP. Your brain is exhausted, not just from the exam itself, but from the months of preparation that preceded it. Trying to immediately pivot into "retake mode" while you're running on fumes and flooded with emotion is a recipe for more burnout, not better performance.

During this time, do the things you neglected while studying. See friends. Go outside. Sleep. Cook a meal that takes longer than 10 minutes. Let your nervous system come down from the sustained stress it's been under.

This isn't a luxury. It's a prerequisite for what comes next.

### Step 2: Understand Your Score Report

When you're ready, and not before, pull up your score report.

Most jurisdictions provide domain-level feedback through ASPPB. You won't get a question-by-question breakdown, but you'll see how you performed across the major content areas: Biological Bases of Behavior, Cognitive-Affective Bases of Behavior, Social and Cultural Bases of Behavior, Growth and Lifespan Development, Assessment and Diagnosis, Treatment/Intervention, Research Methods and Statistics, and Ethical/Legal/Professional Issues.

Look at this data without judgment. You're gathering information, not building a case against yourself. Which domains were your weakest? Were there any surprises, areas you thought you knew well but scored low in? Were there areas where you were strong?

Write it down. You'll need this for Step 4.

### Step 3: Figure Out What Actually Went Wrong

This is the step most people skip, and it's the most important one.

A failing score tells you *that* something went wrong. It doesn't tell you *what*. And the fix depends entirely on the cause. Ask yourself honestly:

**Was it knowledge gaps?** Were there content areas where you genuinely didn't know the material? Maybe you ran out of time in your study schedule and never got to certain domains. Maybe your program didn't cover certain topics in depth.

**Was it test anxiety?** Did you know the material during study sessions but freeze or second-guess yourself during the actual exam? Did physical symptoms (racing heart, nausea, blanking) interfere with your performance?

**Was it burnout?** Were you already exhausted before you walked into the testing center? Had you been studying for months on top of a full-time job, internship, or postdoc? Did you feel flat and disconnected during the exam rather than anxious?

**Was it time management?** Did you run out of time? Did you spend too long on difficult questions early in the exam and rush through later sections?

**Was it the wrong study method?** Did you spend most of your time reading and highlighting rather than actively testing yourself? Did you feel like you were studying a lot but not retaining much?

Each of these problems has a different solution. Treating a test anxiety problem with more flashcards won't help. Treating a knowledge gap problem with breathing exercises won't either. Be honest about what happened.

### Step 4: Change Your Study Approach

Here's the hard truth: if you study the same way and expect different results, you're setting yourself up for the same outcome.

This doesn't mean your previous studying was worthless. You likely learned a lot. But something about your approach didn't get you across the line, and doing more of the same, just harder, just longer, is not a strategy. It's punishment.

I'll go deeper into how to study differently in a section below. For now, the principle is this: identify what didn't work and replace it with something that does.

### Step 5: Handle the Retake Logistics

The administrative side of retaking the EPPP varies by jurisdiction, so you'll need to check with your state or provincial licensing board. Here's the general landscape:

**Waiting period:** Most jurisdictions require a waiting period between attempts, typically 60 to 90 days. Some states allow you to retake sooner. Check with ASPPB or your specific board.

**Re-registration:** You'll generally need to submit a new application to sit for the exam and pay the registration fee again. As of this writing, the EPPP exam fee is $600, plus any fees your jurisdiction charges.

**Attempt limits:** Most jurisdictions allow multiple retakes, though some cap the total number of attempts (commonly 3 to 5, sometimes unlimited). A few require additional coursework or supervision after a certain number of failed attempts.

**Score validity:** In most cases, only your passing score matters. A previous failing score does not follow you once you pass.

Start the re-registration process early so that administrative delays don't eat into your study timeline.

## The 3 Most Common Reasons People Fail (and How to Fix Them)

After years of working with EPPP candidates, I see the same three patterns over and over.

### Reason 1: Passive Studying

This is the single most common reason. The candidate reads textbooks, watches video lectures, highlights notes, and reviews summaries. They spend 200, 300, even 400+ hours studying. And they feel like they know the material, until they sit down for the real exam and can't apply it under pressure.

The research on learning is unambiguous: passive review is one of the least effective ways to build durable, retrievable knowledge. You feel like you're learning because the material is familiar. But familiarity is not the same as recall. Recognizing a concept when you see it explained is fundamentally different from being able to retrieve and apply that concept when given a clinical vignette with four plausible answer choices.

**The fix:** Active recall and spaced repetition. Test yourself constantly. Use practice questions not as a way to measure your progress, but as the primary method of studying. Every time you get a question wrong, that's a learning event, and it's worth more than re-reading the same chapter for the third time.

### Reason 2: Practice Questions That Don't Match the Real Exam

Not all practice question banks are created equal. Some EPPP prep programs use questions that are too easy, too hard, or written in a style that doesn't reflect the actual exam. Trick questions, overly specific minutiae, or poorly worded stems can train you for a test that doesn't exist.

The EPPP tends to test application-level thinking. You'll get clinical vignettes and need to identify the most appropriate diagnosis, treatment approach, or ethical response. Questions that test rote memorization of facts ("In what year did Piaget publish...") are not preparing you for this format.

**The fix:** Use practice materials that match the EPPP's actual style and difficulty. Look for programs that emphasize clinical vignettes, application-based questions, and the kind of "best answer" reasoning the EPPP requires. If your practice exam scores were significantly higher than your real exam score, your practice questions were probably too easy. If they were significantly lower, they may have been testing content that's not actually on the exam.

### Reason 3: Burnout and Mental Health

This one doesn't get talked about enough. Many EPPP candidates are studying while working full-time in demanding clinical positions. They're often in the first year or two post-graduation, dealing with the stress of early career, possibly carrying significant student loan debt, and sometimes navigating major life transitions.

Studying through exhaustion doesn't build knowledge. It degrades it. Sleep deprivation impairs memory consolidation. Chronic stress impairs executive function. If you were running on four hours of sleep and pure anxiety for the weeks leading up to the exam, you weren't performing at your capability on test day. Full stop.

**The fix:** This is not a knowledge problem. It's a sustainability problem. For your retake, build a study schedule that includes rest. Protect your sleep. Study in shorter, focused sessions rather than marathon cramming. If you're dealing with depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns, address those directly, because they will affect your exam performance regardless of how well you know the material.

## How to Study Differently the Second Time

Here's a framework that works. It's not the only way, but it addresses the most common failure points.

**Start with a diagnostic assessment.** Don't guess where your weak spots are. Use a practice exam or diagnostic tool to get data on your performance across all content domains. You already have some data from your score report. Build on it. The goal is a clear, honest picture of where you stand in each area.

**Prioritize by exam weight, not personal comfort.** It's human nature to gravitate toward the topics you already know. Resist that. Look at how heavily each domain is weighted on the exam and cross-reference it with your weakest areas. The domains where you're weakest *and* the exam weight is highest are where your study time will have the biggest payoff.

**Study in shorter, more frequent sessions.** Research on learning consistently shows that distributed practice (studying a little bit many times) outperforms massed practice (studying a lot at once). Four 45-minute sessions across four days beats one 3-hour block. Your brain consolidates information during the gaps between sessions, especially during sleep.

**Test yourself constantly.** Every study session should involve active retrieval. Read less. Quiz yourself more. When you get a question wrong, don't just read the explanation. Come back to that question later and make sure you can get it right from memory.

**Take full-length, timed practice exams.** At least 2 to 3 times during your study period, sit down and take a full 225-question practice exam under real conditions. Timed. No breaks beyond what the real exam allows. No looking things up. This builds your stamina, your time management skills, and your tolerance for the psychological pressure of the exam environment.

**Build in recovery days.** Schedule them in advance. Put them on your calendar. A rest day is not a sign of laziness. It's part of the plan. Your brain needs downtime to consolidate what you've studied. Studying 7 days a week for 12 weeks is not more effective than studying 5 days a week for 14 weeks. It's less effective, and it's more likely to break you.

## A Note About the Emotional Side

We need to talk about this, psychologist to psychologist.

You have spent years learning about cognitive distortions. You can identify them in your clients within minutes. You know about all-or-nothing thinking, fortune-telling, catastrophizing, personalization. You've helped other people challenge these patterns hundreds of times.

And right now, you are probably drowning in them.

"I'm not smart enough to pass this exam." That's all-or-nothing thinking. You completed a doctoral program. You have the knowledge base. One exam result does not erase that.

"I'll never pass. I'm going to have to change careers." That's fortune-telling. You don't have evidence for this. You have evidence that you didn't pass once, under one set of circumstances, with one study approach.

"Everyone is going to judge me." That's mind-reading. Most people in your life either don't know the details of your licensing process or have more compassion about it than you're giving them credit for.

I'm not saying this to minimize what you're feeling. The pain is real and you're allowed to sit with it. But I am saying: practice what you're going to preach to your future clients. Notice the thought. Name the distortion. Ask yourself what you'd say to a client sitting in your chair with the same thought.

And if you need support beyond self-reflection, if you're dealing with depression, persistent anxiety, shame that's interfering with your daily functioning, talk to a therapist. You, of all people, know there's no weakness in that. You chose a profession built on the belief that asking for help is an act of strength. Apply that belief to yourself.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many times can I retake the EPPP?**

This varies by jurisdiction. Most states allow between 3 and 5 attempts. Some have no formal limit. A few require additional coursework, supervision hours, or waiting periods after multiple failed attempts. Check with your specific state licensing board or ASPPB for the rules that apply to you.

**Will a failed attempt show up on my record?**

In most jurisdictions, no. Once you pass, your licensing board records a passing score. Employers typically verify that you hold a valid license, not your score history. Some state boards may have access to your attempt history, but this is generally not shared with employers, clients, or the public.

**Should I use a different study program for my retake?**

Not necessarily a different program entirely, but you should use a different *approach*. If your program offers adaptive features, diagnostics, or different study modes you didn't use the first time, try those. If your program was primarily passive (reading-based, lecture-based) and didn't include substantial practice testing, consider supplementing with a more active-recall-focused tool. The key question isn't "which brand" but rather "does this method actually make me retrieve and apply information, or does it just expose me to it?"

**How long should I study before retaking?**

There's no universal answer, but most successful retakers study for 8 to 16 weeks before their second attempt. The key variable isn't total hours but how effectively you use them. A focused, diagnostic-driven 10-week study plan often outperforms a scattered 20-week one. Use your score report and a fresh diagnostic to build a targeted timeline.

**What if I'm running out of attempts in my state?**

If you're approaching your jurisdiction's attempt limit, consider two things. First, consult directly with your licensing board to understand your options, as some allow petitions for additional attempts or accept passing scores from other jurisdictions. Second, look closely at whether there's a non-knowledge factor (test anxiety, burnout, an untreated mental health concern) that's interfering with your performance, and address it directly before your next attempt.

## Moving Forward

I'm not going to tell you this is going to be easy or that you should feel grateful for the learning experience. Failing the EPPP is painful, expensive, and isolating. You're allowed to be upset about it.

But I will tell you this: a failing score is information. It tells you something didn't work. And now you have the chance to figure out what that was and fix it. That's not optimism. That's problem-solving. It's what you've been trained to do.

thePsychology.ai was built by someone who scored 19% on his first practice exam. I built the adaptive platform specifically because I needed something that would tell me exactly where my gaps were and focus my study time there, instead of letting me waste weeks reviewing material I already knew while ignoring the domains that were actually costing me points. If you're studying for a retake, you can [start free](https://thepsychology.ai?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=cta&utm_campaign=what-to-do-after-failing-the-eppp), no credit card required.

You don't need to have it figured out today. Take your break. Read your score report when you're ready. And when you sit down to study again, study differently.

That's the plan. One step at a time.
