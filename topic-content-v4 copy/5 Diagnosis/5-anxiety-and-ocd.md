## Introduction: Why Anxiety Disorders Matter for Your Practice

When you start working as a psychologist, anxiety disorders will likely be the most common conditions you encounter. They're the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide, which means you'll see them across almost every setting. Whether you're doing therapy, assessments, or consultation work. Understanding these disorders isn't just about passing the EPPP; it's about being prepared for the daily reality of clinical practice.

Here's what makes anxiety disorders particularly important: they often show up alongside other conditions, they respond well to specific treatments when you apply them correctly, and they can significantly disrupt someone's ability to work, maintain relationships, and handle everyday responsibilities. Let's break down what you need to know.

## Understanding the Anxiety Disorders Family

Anxiety disorders all share a common thread: excessive fear and anxiety that leads to behavioral problems. But each disorder has its own specific triggers and patterns. {{M}}Think of it like different types of allergic reactions. They all involve an immune system overreaction, but one person reacts to peanuts while another reacts to pollen.{{/M}} The anxiety response is similar across disorders, but what triggers it and how it manifests varies significantly.

### The Foundation: What Makes Someone Vulnerable?

Before diving into specific disorders, you should understand the risk factors that increase someone's likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder:

- **Stressful life events** (trauma, major transitions, chronic stress)
- **Behavioral inhibition** as a temperament trait (being naturally cautious and withdrawn in unfamiliar situations)
- **Family history** (children with anxious parents are nearly twice as likely to develop anxiety problems)
- **Genetics** (heritability estimates range from 30-50%, with concordance rates of 12-26% for identical twins and 4-15% for fraternal twins)

Notice that genetics plays a role, but it's not destiny. The heritability estimates tell us that environment and learning also matter significantly.

## Separation Anxiety Disorder

This disorder involves excessive fear about being separated from attachment figures. And it's not just for kids. Adults can have it too, though the diagnostic criteria differ slightly in duration.

### Core Features

The person needs at least three of eight symptoms, including:
- Excessive distress when separation is anticipated or happening
- Persistent reluctance to go to places (school, work) due to separation fears
- Physical complaints when separation occurs or is expected

**Duration requirements:** Four weeks for children and adolescents, six months for adults.

### School Refusal: A Common Presentation

{{M}}Picture a child on Sunday evening who starts complaining about stomachaches and headaches that mysteriously disappear on Saturday morning.{{/M}} School refusal often signals separation anxiety disorder, though it can also indicate social anxiety or other conditions. These kids aren't being manipulative. They genuinely experience physical symptoms driven by anxiety. They cry, plead, and sometimes show full panic symptoms when it's time to leave home.

### Treatment Approach

**First-line treatment:** Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that includes:
- Psychoeducation
- Exposure (gradually facing separation)
- Relaxation techniques
- Cognitive restructuring (challenging anxious thoughts)
- Parent training (which significantly improves outcomes for children)

For school refusal specifically, getting the child back to school quickly is crucial to prevent secondary problems like social isolation and academic failure.

## Specific Phobia

Specific phobia is intense fear or anxiety about a particular object or situation that's out of proportion to actual danger. The person either avoids the trigger or endures it with intense distress.

### The Five Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Animal | Snakes, spiders, dogs |
| Natural environment | Heights, storms, water |
| Blood-injection-injury | Seeing blood, needles, medical procedures |
| Situational | Elevators, bridges, flying |
| Other | Vomiting, choking, loud sounds |

**Key diagnostic features:**
- Fear must be persistent (typically six months or longer)
- Must cause significant distress or functional impairment
- Twice as common in girls than boys
- Average onset around age 10

### Why Phobias Develop: Mowrer's Two-Factor Theory

This is important for the EPPP because it explains the maintenance of phobias through learning principles:

**Stage 1. Classical Conditioning:** {{M}}Imagine someone who gets trapped in an elevator during a power outage.{{/M}} The elevator (previously neutral) becomes associated with the frightening experience (being trapped, feeling panic). Now the elevator itself triggers anxiety.

**Stage 2. Operant Conditioning:** The person learns that avoiding elevators prevents anxiety. This avoidance is negatively reinforced (it removes the unpleasant anxiety feeling), which makes the person more likely to avoid elevators in the future. The problem? They never get the chance to learn that elevators are generally safe, so the fear never extinguishes.

### Brain Activity in Specific Phobia

Research shows increased activity in areas responsible for generating emotions:
- Amygdala (fear center)
- Insula
- Anterior cingulate cortex
- Medial prefrontal cortex

And decreased activity in areas that regulate fear:
- Ventromedial prefrontal cortex
- Ventral anterior cingulate cortex

{{M}}It's like having your brain's alarm system stuck on high sensitivity while the system that's supposed to evaluate and calm false alarms isn't working properly.{{/M}}

### Treatment: Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)

**First-line treatment:** ERP alone or as part of CBT

Two main approaches:

1. **Flooding:** Immediate exposure to the most feared stimulus until anxiety naturally decreases
2. **Graded exposure:** Gradual progression from less to more anxiety-provoking stimuli

**What the research tells us:**
- In vivo (real-life) exposure > imaginal exposure
- Therapist-led > self-directed
- Virtual reality may be as effective as in vivo for certain phobias (heights, flying, small animals)

### Special Case: Blood-Injection-Injury Type

This phobia has a unique physiological response. Unlike other phobias where heart rate and blood pressure increase, people with this type experience:
1. Brief increase in heart rate/blood pressure
2. Followed by a sudden decrease that causes fainting

**Treatment modification:** Add applied tension to exposure. The person repeatedly tenses and relaxes large muscle groups to keep blood pressure elevated and prevent fainting.

## Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

This involves fear or anxiety in social situations where the person might be scrutinized by others. {{M}}Think of someone who avoids work presentations not just because they're nervous, but because they're convinced they'll humiliate themselves and everyone will judge them as incompetent.{{/M}}

### Diagnostic Criteria

- Fear of at least one social situation involving possible scrutiny
- Fear that showing anxiety symptoms will be negatively evaluated
- Either avoids the situation or endures it with intense fear
- Fear is excessive for the actual threat
- Persistent (six months or more)
- Causes significant distress or impairment

### Treatment Options

**First-line treatments:**
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy (with cognitive restructuring and exposure)
- SSRIs and SNRIs (antidepressants)

**Interesting finding:** Guided internet-delivered CBT appears equivalent to face-to-face CBT for symptom reduction in adults. This matters for expanding access to treatment, especially for people who avoid in-person appointments due to social anxiety.

## Panic Disorder

Panic disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of either:
- Persistent concern about additional attacks or their consequences, OR
- Significant maladaptive behavior change related to the attacks

### What Is a Panic Attack?

An abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes and includes at least four of 13 symptoms:

| Physical Symptoms | Cognitive Symptoms |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Heart palpitations | Fear of losing control or "going crazy" |
| Sweating | Fear of dying |
| Nausea or abdominal distress | Derealization or depersonalization |
| Dizziness | |
| Paresthesia (tingling/numbness) | |

**Important clinical note:** These symptoms overlap with medical conditions like hyperthyroidism and cardiac arrhythmia. Always rule out medical causes before diagnosing panic disorder.

### Treatment: Panic Control Treatment

This comprehensive CBT approach combines:
- **Interoceptive exposure:** Deliberately creating physical panic symptoms (running in place, spinning, breathing through a straw) to help the person learn these sensations aren't dangerous
- Relaxation techniques
- Symptom control strategies

**Medication:** Some antidepressants and benzodiazepines help, but have high relapse rates when used alone without therapy.

## Agoraphobia

Agoraphobia involves marked fear or anxiety about at least two of five situations:
1. Public transportation
2. Open spaces
3. Enclosed spaces
4. Standing in line or being in crowds
5. Being outside home alone

### The Core Fear

The person fears these situations because escape might be difficult or help might be unavailable if they develop panic symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms. {{M}}It's like someone mapping out their entire day based on proximity to safe exits and familiar people who could help in a crisis. Except the crisis they're avoiding likely won't happen.{{/M}}

### Treatment

**First-line:** In vivo exposure and response prevention

Graded exposure is most common, but intense (non-graded) exposure also works and may have better long-term outcomes. Here's a key finding that might surprise you: adding relaxation, breathing retraining, or cognitive techniques to exposure doesn't significantly improve outcomes. The active ingredient appears to be learning to tolerate high levels of fear and anxiety, not learning to reduce them.

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

GAD involves excessive anxiety and worry about multiple events or activities occurring most days for at least six months. The person finds it difficult to control the worry.

### Diagnostic Requirements

At least three of the following (one for children):
- Restlessness
- Being easily fatigued
- Difficulty concentrating
- Irritability
- Muscle tension
- Sleep disturbance

Associated physical symptoms include sweating, nausea, headaches, dizziness, breathlessness, and visual disturbances.

### What Makes GAD Different from Normal Worry?

| Normal Worry | GAD |
|--------------|-----|
| Controllable | Feels uncontrollable |
| Limited topics | Many different topics |
| Minimal physical symptoms | Significant somatic symptoms |

{{M}}Imagine normal worry as having a few browser tabs open that you're actively working through. GAD is like having 50 tabs open simultaneously, with pop-ups constantly appearing, and you can't figure out which tab is playing that annoying sound.{{/M}}

The content of worry varies by age: Children worry about catastrophic events and their competence; older adults worry about health and safety.

### Why Do People with GAD Worry? Three Theoretical Models

**1. Cognitive Avoidance Theory (Borkovec)**
Worry is a verbal-linguistic activity that creates low mental imagery. This helps people with GAD avoid vivid, disturbing images and the intense emotions that accompany them. {{M}}It's like reading a news article about a car accident rather than watching video footage. Both convey information, but one is easier to tolerate emotionally.{{/M}}

**2. Contrast Avoidance Model (Newman & Llera)**
People with GAD maintain chronic worry to stay in a sustained negative emotional state, which prevents jarring shifts from positive/neutral states to negative states when something bad happens. They'd rather feel consistently moderately anxious than experience sudden emotional drops.

**3. Intolerance of Uncertainty Model (Dugas)**
Four factors characterize GAD worry:
- Low tolerance for ambiguity
- Poor problem-solving in uncertain situations
- Overestimating the benefits of worrying (like believing worry prevents bad outcomes)
- Cognitive avoidance of threatening mental images

### Brain Abnormalities in GAD

Research shows reduced connectivity between prefrontal cortex regions and the amygdala, suggesting weak top-down control of the amygdala's fear responses. {{M}}The prefrontal cortex should be able to tell the amygdala to calm down when there's no real threat, but that communication line isn't working efficiently.{{/M}}

### Treatment

**First-line:** CBT and/or pharmacotherapy

**Medication options:**
- SSRIs and SNRIs (first-line)
- Buspirone (adjunctive when antidepressants are partially effective, or sole medication if antidepressants don't work)
- Benzodiazepines (short-term acute relief only, due to tolerance and dependence risks)

**Treatment enhancement:** Adding motivational interviewing as a pretreatment to CBT reduces treatment resistance and improves outcomes.

## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

OCD involves recurrent obsessions and/or compulsions that are time-consuming (more than one hour daily) and/or cause significant distress or impairment.

### Defining the Key Terms

**Obsessions:** Recurrent, persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are:
- Intrusive and unwanted
- Attempted to be ignored or suppressed
- Usually cause marked anxiety or distress

**Compulsions:** Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that:
- The person feels driven to perform
- Are done in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules
- Aim to reduce anxiety or prevent something bad (but are excessive or unrealistically connected to their goal)

{{M}}Think of obsessions as intrusive spam emails that keep appearing in your inbox no matter how many times you delete them, and compulsions as the repetitive checking and deleting behaviors you perform trying to make them stop. Except the behaviors actually make the spam worse by confirming your email address is active.{{/M}}

### Demographics and Comorbidity

- Males have earlier onset than females (higher childhood prevalence)
- Females have slightly higher adult prevalence
- Most common comorbid condition: anxiety disorders

### Biological Basis

**Genetics:** 
- Heritability: 27-57% for adults, 45-65% for children
- Concordance rates: 57% for identical twins, 22% for fraternal twins

**Brain abnormalities:**
Hyperactivity in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway, which controls movement execution, habit formation, and reward. This hyperactivity involves:
- Orbitofrontal cortex
- Anterior cingulate cortex
- Basal ganglia regions
- Thalamus
- Amygdala

### Treatment

**First-line:** Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) alone or as part of CBT

For OCD, ERP is also called "exposure with ritual prevention." You expose the person to anxiety-provoking thoughts, objects, or situations while preventing ritualistic behaviors.

**SSRIs** are also first-line treatments.

**Research findings on combined treatment:**
Combined ERP + SSRI is most effective when:
- Either treatment alone has failed
- Symptoms are severe
- Comorbid conditions exist that respond to antidepressants

For children and adolescents: ERP (in-person or telehealth) is about equally effective, and ERP alone or ERP + SSRI outperforms SSRI alone.

## Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)

BDD involves preoccupation with a perceived defect or flaw in physical appearance that's either not observable or appears minor to others.

### Diagnostic Requirements

- Preoccupation with perceived appearance defect
- Has performed repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response (mirror checking, skin picking, reassurance seeking)
- Causes significant distress or impairment

### Clinical Presentation

People with BDD often:
- Seek medical/cosmetic treatment for the perceived flaw
- Have ideas or delusions of reference (believe others are mocking them or taking special notice of their appearance)

{{M}}Someone with BDD might spend hours examining a barely visible scar in different lighting conditions, convinced it's grotesque, while everyone else doesn't even notice it unless it's pointed out.{{/M}}

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception 1:** "Benzodiazepines are a good long-term treatment for anxiety."
**Reality:** Benzos are only for short-term acute relief. Long-term use leads to tolerance and physical dependence.

**Misconception 2:** "Adding relaxation techniques to exposure therapy improves outcomes."
**Reality:** For agoraphobia specifically, research shows that adding relaxation, breathing retraining, or cognitive techniques doesn't significantly improve outcomes beyond exposure alone. The key is learning to tolerate high anxiety, not reduce it.

**Misconception 3:** "OCD is just about being neat and organized."
**Reality:** OCD involves intrusive, unwanted thoughts that cause significant distress and time-consuming rituals that are performed to reduce anxiety. Not preference for organization.

**Misconception 4:** "Specific phobias always develop from traumatic experiences with the feared object."
**Reality:** While classical conditioning explains many phobias, genetics and brain activity also play significant roles. Not everyone with a dog phobia was bitten by a dog.

**Misconception 5:** "People with social anxiety disorder are just shy."
**Reality:** Social anxiety disorder involves excessive fear that's out of proportion to actual threat, causes significant impairment, and involves either avoidance or intense distress. Shyness is a personality trait that doesn't necessarily cause functional impairment.

## Memory Aids for the EPPP

**Panic Attack Symptoms. Remember "STUDENTS FEAR CRASHING":**
- **S**weating
- **T**rembling
- **U**nsteadiness/dizziness
- **D**epersonalization/derealization
- **E**levated heart rate
- **N**umbness/tingling
- **T**errorized (fear of dying)
- **S**hortness of breath

- **F**ear of losing control
- **E**xcessive worry about consequences
- **A**bdominal distress
- **R**epeated attacks

- **C**hest pain
- **R**eaches peak in minutes
- **A**void places
- **S**ensation of choking
- **H**eat sensations/chills
- **I**ntense fear
- **N**eed 4+ symptoms
- **G**oing crazy fear

**Exposure Types:**
- **Flooding** = Full immersion (like jumping into the deep end)
- **Graded** = Gradual steps (like using the stairs of a pool)

**GAD vs. Normal Worry:**
If you can't control it, it covers multiple topics, and it comes with physical symptoms. That's GAD territory.

**OCD Treatment Success:**
Remember "ERP FIRST". Exposure and Response Prevention is the first-line psychological treatment, whether alone or with SSRIs.

## Clinical Application Tips

**For Separation Anxiety:**
When you see school refusal, don't just treat the school avoidance. Look for the underlying separation anxiety and involve parents in treatment. Getting kids back to school quickly prevents cascading problems.

**For Specific Phobias:**
Match your treatment to the phobia type. Blood-injection-injury phobia needs applied tension added to exposure. Virtual reality can work for heights, flying, and small animals.

**For GAD:**
Consider motivational interviewing as a pretreatment to increase engagement with CBT. Many people with GAD have developed positive beliefs about worry that create resistance to letting it go.

**For OCD:**
Don't settle for partial improvement with SSRIs alone if the person can tolerate ERP. The combination works better for severe symptoms.

**For Panic Disorder:**
Medical rule-outs are essential. Document that you've considered hyperthyroidism, cardiac issues, and other medical explanations.
