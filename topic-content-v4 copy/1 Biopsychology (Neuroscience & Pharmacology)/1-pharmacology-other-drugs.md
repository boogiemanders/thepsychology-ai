## Why These "Other" Psychoactive Drugs Matter for Your EPPP Success

When you're knee-deep in EPPP prep, it's easy to focus all your energy on the heavy hitters: antidepressants and antipsychotics. But here's the reality check, the exam loves to test your knowledge of the full medication toolbox. Understanding sedatives, mood stabilizers, ADHD medications, and drugs for substance use disorders isn't just about passing the test. These medications show up constantly in real clinical work, and knowing their mechanisms, side effects, and contraindications will make you a more competent psychologist from day one.

This lesson breaks down the "other" psychoactive drugs you need to know for the EPPP. We'll cover everything from benzodiazepines to beta-blockers, from ADHD stimulants to emerging psychedelic therapies. More importantly, we'll help you remember these details using practical connections and clear comparisons.

## Sedatives, Hypnotics, and Anxiolytics: The Calming Agents

### Benzodiazepines: Fast Relief with a Catch

Benzodiazepines include diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan). These drugs work by increasing GABA activity.

**Naming tip:** You can easily identify a benzodiazepine because almost all generic names end in "-pam" or "-lam" (alprazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam). Essentially turning up the volume on your brain's natural "calm down" system. They're used for anxiety, insomnia, seizures, and alcohol withdrawal.

Here's the crucial comparison for the exam: **Benzodiazepines versus SSRIs/SNRIs for anxiety**. {{M}}Think of benzodiazepines as the fast-food option{{/M}}. They work quickly (within 30-60 minutes), provide immediate relief, and are great when you need rapid results. But just like fast food, they're not ideal for long-term use. Benzodiazepines excel at reducing physical anxiety symptoms (racing heart, sweating, trembling) but don't do much for the cognitive symptoms (worried thoughts, rumination). They also come with significant risks: tolerance, physical dependence, and withdrawal problems.

SSRIs and SNRIs, in contrast, {{M}}are more like meal prepping for the week{{/M}}. They take longer to show effects (2-4 weeks), but they're better for sustained, long-term anxiety management. They target cognitive symptoms more effectively and don't create the same dependence issues, though they come with their own side effect profile.

**Common side effects** of benzodiazepines include drowsiness, sedation, weakness, memory impairment, and confusion (especially in older adults). Watch for the **paradoxical effect** (particularly in children and elderly patients) where the drug causes the opposite of its intended effect, producing excitability and increased anxiety instead of calmness.

**Critical safety concerns:**
- Combining benzodiazepines with alcohol creates a synergistic depressant effect that can be lethal
- Abrupt discontinuation after long-term use can cause rebound anxiety, seizures, and severe withdrawal
- Tapering schedules must be longer for short-half-life benzodiazepines like alprazolam and lorazepam

### Barbiturates: The Old Guard

Barbiturates like thiopental (Pentothal) and secobarbital (Seconal) also enhance GABA activity. They're less commonly prescribed today because they're more dangerous than benzodiazepines. They're used as general anesthetics and for treating anxiety, insomnia, and seizures.

Side effects mirror benzodiazepines: drowsiness, confusion, cognitive impairment, and paradoxical excitement. The danger level is higher, though. Sudden withdrawal can cause seizures, delirium, and death. Like benzodiazepines, mixing barbiturates with alcohol can be fatal.

### Azapirones: The Safer Alternative

Buspirone (BuSpar) represents a different approach to treating generalized anxiety disorder. The major advantages: no sedation, no dependence, no tolerance. Side effects are relatively mild. Dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, headache. This makes buspirone a good option for patients with a history of substance use or those who need to remain alert for work or driving.

## Narcotic-Analgesics (Opioids): Pain Relief and Public Health Crisis

Opioids mimic your body's natural pain relievers (endorphins and enkephalins). This category includes natural opioids (morphine, heroin, codeine) and synthetic versions (methadone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl).

**Clinical uses:** pre-surgery anesthetic, pain management, and heroin detoxification (methadone). Methadone works by reducing heroin cravings and withdrawal symptoms without producing heroin's euphoric effects.

**Side effects** include dry mouth, nausea, constricted pupils, drowsiness, constipation, and respiratory depression. Overdose can cause convulsions, coma, and death. Here's a sobering fact for the exam: **drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental deaths in the U.S., with opioids being the most frequent cause**.

Chronic use leads to dependence and tolerance. Withdrawal symptoms start flu-like (runny nose, watery eyes, muscle aches, fever, yawning), then progress to more severe symptoms (insomnia, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure).

## Beta-Blockers: Calming the Body's Alarm System

Beta-blockers like propranolol (Inderal) work by inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity. Primary uses include hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, migraines, and essential tremor.

For psychologists, the key use is **anxiety treatment** (specifically, the physical symptoms of anxiety. Propranolol is particularly effective for performance anxiety. {{M}}Picture a musician about to perform on stage or someone giving a major presentation{{/M}}) propranolol reduces the trembling hands, racing heart, and sweating, but doesn't do much for the psychological worry and dread. This makes it useful for situational anxiety where physical symptoms are the main concern.

**Important warning:** Never stop beta-blockers abruptly. Sudden discontinuation can cause rebound hypertension, tremors, headaches, confusion, and cardiac arrhythmia. Tapering is essential.

## Mood Stabilizers: Managing Bipolar Disorder

### Lithium: The Gold Standard

Lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid) remains the first-line treatment for acute mania and classic bipolar disorder (euphoric mania without rapid cycling). It's one of the oldest psychiatric medications still in wide use.

Common side effects: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste, increased thirst, weight gain, hand tremor, fatigue, memory impairment. The critical concern with lithium is its **narrow therapeutic window**, the difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose is small. Lithium levels require regular monitoring to avoid toxicity, which can cause seizures, coma, and death.

### Anticonvulsant Drugs: The Alternatives

Carbamazepine (Tegretol) and valproic acid (Depakene) are used for acute mania and bipolar disorder with mixed episodes. Side effects include nausea, dizziness, sleepiness, ataxia, tremor, visual disturbances, and impaired concentration.

**Critical monitoring requirements:**
- Valproic acid: Monitor for liver failure
- Carbamazepine: Monitor for liver failure, agranulocytosis (low white blood cells), and aplastic anemia

## Drugs for Alzheimer's Disease: Slowing Cognitive Decline

Two categories of medications help slow Alzheimer's progression:

**Cholinesterase inhibitors** delay the breakdown of acetylcholine. These include tacrine (Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Razadyne). All are approved for mild and moderate Alzheimer's; donepezil is also approved for severe cases. Tacrine is rarely prescribed anymore due to liver failure risk.

**NMDA receptor antagonists** like memantine (Namenda) are approved for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. Memantine works by regulating glutamate activity.

{{M}}Think of cholinesterase inhibitors as preventing your brain's communication signals from degrading too quickly, while memantine helps regulate the traffic flow of excitatory neurotransmitters.{{/M}}

## ADHD Medications: First, Second, and Third-Line Treatments

### Psychostimulants: The First-Line Approach

Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), pemoline (Cylert), and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall) are the go-to medications for ADHD. They increase dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex, improving attention, concentration, and reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity.

**Important exam point:** While stimulants clearly improve attention and reduce ADHD symptoms, their effects on academic achievement when used alone are unclear. They're most effective when combined with behavioral interventions.

Common side effects: insomnia, nervousness, decreased appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain. Stimulants can suppress growth in children, but "drug holidays" during school vacations can reverse this effect.

**Worth noting:** Research shows that when people without ADHD use stimulants for cognitive enhancement, they may increase attention and positive mood but don't improve reading comprehension and may actually impair working memory and academic performance.

### Second-Line Medications

Prescribed when patients can't tolerate stimulants, don't respond adequately, have significant comorbidities, or are at high risk for stimulant misuse:

**Atomoxetine (Strattera):** A norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and the most common nonstimulant for ADHD. More effective than stimulants for patients with comorbid tic disorders, sleep disorders, anxiety, or depression.

**Guanfacine (Intuniv) and Clonidine (Kapvay):** Alpha-2-adrenergic agonists originally developed for high blood pressure. They improve core ADHD symptoms but are typically reserved for patients who also have Tourette's disorder or other tic disorders.

### Third-Line Medications

Several antidepressants are used when other options fail: the tricyclic desipramine (Norpramin) and the NDRI bupropion (Wellbutrin). Like stimulants, they increase brain levels of dopamine and norepinephrine.

## Drugs for Substance Use Disorders: Supporting Recovery

### Alcohol Use Disorder

| Medication | Mechanism | Key Features |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Disulfiram (Antabuse) | Causes severe unpleasant reaction when combined with alcohol | Nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, throbbing headache when drinking |
| Naltrexone (ReVia) | Reduces pleasurable effects and craving | Blocks reward pathway |
| Acamprosate (Campral) | Reduces craving only | No effect on pleasure |
| Topiramate (Topamax) | Anti-seizure med used off-label | Reduces craving and pleasurable effects |

### Tobacco Use Disorder

**Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT):** Provides stable low levels of nicotine to prevent withdrawal symptoms that trigger relapse. {{M}}It's like gradually stepping down from a high-caffeine habit by switching to progressively weaker coffee rather than quitting cold turkey.{{/M}}

**Bupropion:** Originally an antidepressant, also reduces nicotine craving and withdrawal symptoms.

**Varenicline:** Reduces craving and appears to reduce the rewarding effects of smoking.

### Cocaine Use Disorder

No FDA-approved medications exist yet. However, recent meta-analyses suggest bupropion, topiramate, and certain psychostimulants (modafinil, dextroamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts) may help increase abstinence.

## Emerging Treatments and Special Categories

### THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)

THC stimulates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (part of the brain's reward pathway). Dronabinol oral solution (Syndros) is FDA-approved for treating AIDS-related anorexia and weight loss, plus chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in cancer patients who haven't responded to other treatments.

### Psychedelic Drugs

The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designations (not full approval, but expedited review) to:
- **LSD** for generalized anxiety disorder
- **Psilocybin** for major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression

Both are serotonin agonists, though LSD also increases dopamine effects and psilocybin alters glutamate levels. This represents a significant shift in psychiatric research and may appear on future EPPP exams as these treatments gain traction.

## Critical Pharmacology Concepts: The Technical Details That Matter

### Drug Half-Life: Timing Is Everything

The half-life is the time needed for blood levels to decrease to 50% of peak levels. This determines dosing intervals. Short half-life means more frequent doses, and vice versa.

**Critical age-related consideration:** Older adults have longer half-lives for most psychoactive drugs due to age-related changes in metabolism and elimination. {{M}}If a benzodiazepine normally leaves a younger person's system in 24 hours, it might take 72+ hours in an older adult, like the difference between trash pickup once a week versus once a month.{{/M}}

This is why the prescribing rule for older adults is "**start low and go slow**". Begin with low doses and gradually increase until you reach therapeutic effects.

### Tolerance and Cross-Tolerance

**Tolerance:** Repeated use leads to reduced effects, requiring higher doses to achieve the same result.

**Cross-tolerance:** Tolerance to one drug creates tolerance to others in the same class. For example, alcohol tolerance produces tolerance to benzodiazepines and barbiturates because they're all central nervous system depressants.

### Therapeutic Index: Measuring Drug Safety

The therapeutic index (TI) measures how safe a drug is:

**Animal studies formula:** LD50/ED50
- LD50 (lethal dose 50): Minimum dose that was lethal to 50% of subjects
- ED50 (effective dose 50): Minimum dose that produced therapeutic effect in 50% of subjects

**Human studies formula:** TD50/ED50
- TD50 (toxic dose 50): Minimum dose that had toxic effect in 50% of subjects
- ED50: Same as above

**Narrow therapeutic window (TI = 1.0 or less):** The therapeutic dose is equal to or higher than the toxic/lethal dose. These drugs are dangerous and require close monitoring. Lithium is a classic example.

**Wide therapeutic window (TI greater than 1.0):** The therapeutic dose is lower than the toxic/lethal dose. These drugs are safer and more desirable.

{{M}}Think of therapeutic window like the margin of error in following a recipe (some recipes are forgiving (cookies), while others require exact measurements or they become inedible (soufflés). Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows are like soufflés) precision matters enormously.{{/M}}

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**Misconception #1:** "Benzodiazepines are always preferable to SSRIs for anxiety because they work faster."
**Reality:** This depends entirely on the clinical picture. Acute situational anxiety? Benzodiazepines might be appropriate. Chronic anxiety disorder? SSRIs/SNRIs are typically better long-term choices despite slower onset.

**Misconception #2:** "Stimulants improve academic performance for everyone."
**Reality:** For people with ADHD, stimulants improve focus and symptom management. For people without ADHD, they may increase attention but can impair working memory and overall academic performance.

**Misconception #3:** "All mood stabilizers work the same way."
**Reality:** Lithium, anticonvulsants, and some atypical antipsychotics are all used as mood stabilizers, but they have different mechanisms, side effect profiles, and monitoring requirements.

**Misconception #4:** "Methadone just replaces one addiction with another."
**Reality:** Methadone maintenance is evidence-based treatment that reduces heroin craving and withdrawal without producing euphoria, allowing people to stabilize their lives and engage in recovery.

**Misconception #5:** "You can stop beta-blockers whenever you want since they're not addictive."
**Reality:** Beta-blockers require tapering. Abrupt discontinuation can cause serious rebound effects including dangerous blood pressure spikes and cardiac problems.

## Memory Strategies for EPPP Success

**For drug classes and mechanisms:**
Create acronym systems. For benzodiazepines: **DAL** (Diazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam) all increase **GABA**.

**For comparing benzodiazepines vs. SSRIs:**
Make a simple comparison chart:

| Feature | Benzodiazepines | SSRIs/SNRIs |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Onset | Fast (30-60 min) | Slow (2-4 weeks) |
| Best for | Physical symptoms, acute anxiety | Cognitive symptoms, chronic anxiety |
| Duration | Short-term | Long-term |
| Dependence risk | High | Low |

**For medication side effects:**
Group by body system (GI effects, cardiovascular effects, CNS effects) rather than trying to memorize every drug individually.

**For therapeutic index:**
Remember: **Higher TI = Safer drug**. If ED50 is much lower than LD50/TD50, you have a wide therapeutic window.

**For ADHD medication hierarchy:**
Think "1-2-3": (1) Stimulants first, (2) Atomoxetine and alpha-agonists second, (3) Antidepressants third.

## Key Takeaways for the EPPP

- **Benzodiazepines** increase GABA, work fast, great for acute anxiety and physical symptoms, but carry dependence and tolerance risks. Never combine with alcohol. Taper slowly when discontinuing.

- **Barbiturates** are older, more dangerous versions of benzodiazepines with similar uses and higher lethality risk.

- **Buspirone** is the anxiety medication without sedation, dependence, or tolerance. Useful for GAD and patients with substance use history.

- **Opioids** are effective for pain but are the leading cause of accidental overdose deaths in the U.S. Methadone reduces heroin craving without euphoria.

- **Beta-blockers** (especially propranolol) reduce physical anxiety symptoms better than psychological symptoms. Think performance anxiety. Require tapering, not abrupt discontinuation.

- **Lithium** is first-line for classic bipolar disorder but has a narrow therapeutic window requiring regular blood level monitoring to avoid toxicity.

- **Anticonvulsants** like carbamazepine and valproic acid treat bipolar with mixed episodes and require monitoring for serious side effects including liver failure.

- **Alzheimer's medications** include cholinesterase inhibitors (delay acetylcholine breakdown) and memantine (regulates glutamate).

- **ADHD stimulants** are first-line treatment and work by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex. They improve symptoms but effects on academic achievement alone are unclear. Don't improve and may impair performance in people without ADHD.

- **Non-stimulant ADHD medications** are second-line treatments for patients who can't tolerate stimulants, have comorbidities, or are at risk for misuse. Atomoxetine is most common; alpha-agonists are used when tics are present.

- **Substance use disorder medications** vary by substance: Disulfiram creates aversive reaction to alcohol; naltrexone reduces reward; NRT, bupropion, and varenicline support smoking cessation.

- **Drug half-life** is longer in older adults, requiring "start low and go slow" approach to prescribing.

- **Therapeutic index** measures safety: Higher numbers mean wider therapeutic windows and safer drugs. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window.

- **Cross-tolerance** occurs between drugs in the same class. Alcohol tolerance creates benzodiazepine and barbiturate tolerance.

Understanding these medications isn't just about exam success. It's about becoming a psychologist who can collaborate effectively with prescribers, educate clients about their medications, recognize concerning side effects, and provide comprehensive, integrated care. Keep these principles clear, and you'll handle EPPP questions on psychopharmacology with confidence.
