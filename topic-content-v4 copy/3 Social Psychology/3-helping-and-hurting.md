## Why This Matters for Your Psychology Career

Every day, people make split-second decisions about whether to help someone, who to trust, and how to treat others. These decisions shape everything from workplace dynamics to life-or-death situations. Understanding prosocial behavior and prejudice isn't just about passing the EPPP. It's about recognizing patterns that affect your clients, your community, and yes, even your own behavior. Whether you're working in clinical practice, organizational settings, or research, these concepts will help you understand why people act the way they do when others need help, and why discrimination persists even among people who genuinely believe in equality.

Let's break this down into practical, memorable pieces.

## When Bad Things Happen: The Bystander Effect

In 1964, Kitty Genovese was murdered outside her apartment while 38 people allegedly heard her screams. (Note: later research showed the original story was exaggerated, but it still sparked crucial research.) The shocking part wasn't just the crime. It was that nobody called for help. This launched decades of research into why people fail to help in emergencies.

### The Five Steps to Helping (And Where Things Go Wrong)

Latané and Darley discovered that helping someone isn't automatic. It's a decision process with five steps, and each step has obstacles:

**Step 1: Noticing the Event**

You can't help if you don't notice something's wrong. The main barrier? **Stimulus overload**, especially in busy environments. {{M}}Think about walking through a crowded downtown area during rush hour. Your brain filters out most of what's happening because otherwise you'd be overwhelmed by every conversation, car horn, and storefront display.{{/M}} Unfortunately, this filtering can cause you to miss genuine emergencies.

**Step 2: Interpreting It as an Emergency**

Even when you notice something unusual, you might misread the situation. **Pluralistic ignorance** creates a dangerous loop: {{M}}You see someone collapsed on the sidewalk, but other people are walking past calmly. You think, "Well, they're not stopping, so maybe this person is just sleeping or drunk, not having a medical emergency."{{/M}} Meanwhile, everyone else is thinking the exact same thing. Everyone looks to everyone else for cues, and everyone collectively decides it's not serious.

**Step 3: Taking Responsibility**

Here's where the **diffusion of responsibility** kicks in. When multiple people are present, each person feels less personally responsible. The math is brutal: more bystanders = less likelihood of any single person helping. {{M}}It's similar to being in a group text where someone asks a question. With 10 people in the chat, you might think "someone else will answer this" and scroll past. But if it's just you and one other person? You feel much more pressure to respond.{{/M}}

Research confirms that victims are most likely to receive help when only one bystander is present.

**Step 4: Knowing How to Help**

Sometimes you recognize an emergency and feel responsible, but you're paralyzed by uncertainty. If you don't know CPR or how to handle the situation, you might freeze or defer to someone else.

**Step 5: Deciding to Actually Help**

Even when you know what to do, **evaluation apprehension** (also called audience inhibition) can stop you. You worry: What if I'm wrong about this being an emergency? What if I make things worse? What if everyone thinks I'm overreacting?

### Urban vs. Rural Helping

Research consistently shows people are less likely to help in urban areas than rural ones. Interestingly, it's not about where you grew up. It's about where you are right now. Someone raised in a small town is just as unlikely to help in a city as someone who's lived there their whole life. The current environment matters more than your background.

## Why Do People Help? Altruism vs. Egoism

When people do help, what motivates them? Two competing theories offer different answers:

**The Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis** suggests people help because they genuinely care about others' well-being. You help because you feel empathic concern. You're focused on reducing the other person's suffering, not your own discomfort.

**The Negative State Relief Model** takes a more cynical view: you help to make yourself feel better. {{M}}Maybe you see someone struggling with groceries in a parking lot, and helping them relieves the guilt or discomfort you'd feel if you just walked away.{{/M}} You're still helping, but the motivation is self-focused.

Current research favors the empathy-altruism hypothesis. More importantly, people who help for altruistic reasons tend to keep helping over time, while those motivated by egoism burn out faster.

## Reducing Conflict Through Cooperation

Sherif's famous Robbers Cave study (1966) showed how quickly groups can turn hostile. And how to fix it. {{M}}Imagine taking two groups of kids to summer camp, creating strong team identities, then pitting them against each other in competitions.{{/M}} The groups quickly became hostile, calling each other names and eventually stealing from each other.

The solution? **Superordinate goals**. Objectives that could only be achieved through cooperation between groups. When the water supply "broke" and both groups had to work together to fix it, hostility decreased.

This principle led to the **jigsaw classroom** technique. In diverse classrooms, students are divided into multiethnic groups where each person learns one piece of a project and teaches it to their teammates. {{M}}It's like assembling furniture where each person has instructions for one section. You need everyone's piece to complete the whole thing.{{/M}}

Results were impressive: reduced prejudice, improved self-esteem and empathy for all students, and better academic performance for minority students without hurting majority students' performance.

## Why Prejudice Exists: Six Major Theories

Understanding discrimination requires looking at multiple explanations. Here's what research has identified:

| Theory | Core Idea | Key Example |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Realistic Conflict Theory** | Groups compete for limited resources, creating hostility | Competition for jobs during economic downturns increases racial tension |
| **Social Identity Theory** | People naturally categorize into groups and favor their in-group | Sports fans feel superior to rival team fans, even when randomly assigned to teams |
| **Scapegoat Theory** | Dominant groups blame weak groups for their frustrations | Economic hardship leads to increased discrimination against minorities |
| **Authoritarian Personality** | Harsh upbringing creates personality prone to extreme prejudice | People who score high on "F Scale" show more ethnocentrism |
| **Terror Management Theory** | Awareness of death makes people cling to cultural worldviews and reject outsiders | Reminders of mortality increase negative reactions to out-group members |
| **Dehumanization** | Viewing others as less than fully human justifies mistreatment | Infrahumanization: attributing fewer complex emotions to out-group members |

### Deep Dive: Terror Management Theory

This one's particularly interesting for the EPPP. Terror Management Theory (TMT) argues that humans have a unique problem: we're biologically driven to survive, but we're smart enough to know we'll die anyway. This creates existential terror.

To cope, we invest in two defenses:
1. Cultural worldview (our beliefs about how the world works and what gives life meaning)
2. Self-esteem (feeling we meet our culture's standards of value)

When reminded of death (called **mortality salience**) people grip these defenses tighter. They evaluate in-group members more positively and out-group members more negatively. They also prefer people who confirm stereotypes because stereotypes make the world feel more predictable and orderly.

Researchers increase mortality salience through various methods: asking people to imagine their death, interviewing them near funeral homes, or flashing death-related words during computer tasks.

### Infrahumanization: A Subtle Form of Dehumanization

Rather than viewing out-groups as completely non-human (blatant dehumanization), **infrahumanization** sees them as less fully human. The theory distinguishes between:

- **Primary emotions** (anger, fear, surprise): we attribute these to everyone, including animals
- **Secondary emotions** (pride, shame, hope, disappointment): uniquely human complex emotions

People attribute more secondary emotions to their in-group members, which generates empathy and prosocial behavior. They attribute fewer secondary emotions to out-group members, reducing empathy and acceptance.

## Reducing Prejudice: The Contact Hypothesis

Allport's contact hypothesis remains foundational. Simply putting different groups together isn't enough. Contact reduces prejudice when:

1. **Equal status**: Members have the same power and position
2. **Common goals**: They work toward shared objectives (remember superordinate goals?)
3. **No competition**: They're not fighting for limited resources
4. **Institutional support**: Authority figures sanction the contact

{{M}}Think about workplaces where diversity initiatives fail versus succeed. A company that just hires diverse employees but maintains a competitive, hierarchical culture probably won't see reduced prejudice. But a company that creates cross-functional teams with equal roles, shared projects, and leadership support for collaboration? Much more effective.{{/M}}

## Modern Racism: When Prejudice Goes Underground

Overt racism (openly hostile attitudes and blatant discrimination) has decreased, but **covert racism** persists in more subtle forms. This matters enormously for your clinical work because your clients will encounter it constantly, and you need to recognize it.

### Three Types of Covert Racism

**Symbolic Racism**: People believe in equality and deny that discrimination exists, while simultaneously believing that minority groups violate traditional values and that their struggles are due to lack of effort. {{M}}It's like someone saying, "I'm not racist, but those people just need to work harder. Look at me. I worked hard and succeeded, so anyone can."{{/M}} This person opposes policies like affirmative action as "unfair" while ignoring historical and systemic barriers.

**Aversive Racism**: People have a non-prejudiced self-image and genuinely believe they're egalitarian, but harbor negative feelings about minorities (often unconscious) acquired in childhood. They avoid contact with minorities when possible and discriminate only when they can justify it on non-racial grounds. {{M}}Picture a hiring manager who prefers the white candidate because of "cultural fit" or "better communication style". Criteria that seem neutral but mask racial bias.{{/M}}

**Ambivalent Racism**: People hold conflicting positive and negative attitudes toward minorities, creating emotional tension. To reduce this tension, they respond in extreme ways (either very positively or very negatively. The response depends on the situation. {{M}}Someone might be extra generous to a minority person in one context but harshly judgmental in another) both responses more extreme than they'd show toward a majority group member in similar situations.{{/M}}

## Four Levels of Racism

The APA identifies racism operating at multiple levels. This framework is crucial for understanding how discrimination persists:

| Level | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Structural** | Laws and policies that create race-based inequalities | Funding schools through property taxes, which perpetuates wealth gaps from historical redlining |
| **Institutional** | Organizational practices that marginalize racial groups | Zero-tolerance school policies that disproportionately suspend minority students |
| **Interpersonal** | Individual behaviors that harm other racial groups | Microaggressions: subtle comments that communicate hostile or demeaning messages |
| **Internalized** | Acceptance of negative stereotypes about one's own group | Colorism: minorities accepting negative beliefs about darker skin tones |

**Microaggressions** deserve special attention. These are "brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities" that communicate negative racial messages. {{M}}Examples include clutching your purse when a Black man enters an elevator, expressing surprise that a Latina is "so articulate," or repeatedly asking an Asian American "where are you really from?"{{/M}} They're often unintentional, but the cumulative impact is significant.

## Sexism: Hostile and Benevolent

**Ambivalent sexism theory** reveals that sexism comes in two forms that work together to maintain gender inequality:

**Hostile sexism**: Direct antipathy toward women who challenge traditional gender roles (feminists, career women, assertive women)

**Benevolent sexism**: Seemingly positive but paternalistic attitudes toward women who embrace conventional roles, treating them as needing protection and being inherently delicate or pure

{{M}}Imagine a workplace where men resent a female manager who's assertive and ambitious (hostile sexism) but are "chivalrous" toward the female receptionist, insisting on helping her with tasks she can easily do herself (benevolent sexism).{{/M}} Both attitudes reinforce the idea that women are inferior and should stay in traditional roles.

Research shows men often reconcile these competing attitudes by categorizing women into two types: those who "deserve" hostility (rule-breakers) and those who "deserve" benevolence (rule-followers).

## Stereotypes: Self-Fulfilling and Performance-Damaging

### Self-Stereotyping

People unconsciously internalize stereotypes applied to their groups. Surprisingly, this can sometimes protect self-esteem. Research shows women are more likely to endorse the "women are bad at math" stereotype after failing a math test. It provides an external explanation that protects their self-concept.

### Stereotype Threat

**Stereotype threat** occurs when situational factors activate negative stereotypes, causing people to conform to them. The mechanism? The threat increases anxiety and negative self-talk, consuming cognitive resources needed for the task.

{{M}}Imagine taking a difficult exam while simultaneously monitoring yourself for signs that you're confirming a negative stereotype about your group, worrying about what others will think, and battling intrusive thoughts about failure.{{/M}} That mental load directly impairs performance.

Classic example: Older adults performed worse on memory tasks after reading articles confirming age-related memory decline, but not after reading articles refuting the stereotype. Simply activating the stereotype impaired their actual memory performance.

## Shooter Bias: When Stereotypes Turn Deadly

Shooter bias research uses videogame simulations where participants quickly decide whether to shoot suspects holding either guns or harmless objects. The bias appears in two ways:

1. **Response time**: Faster decisions to shoot armed Black suspects than armed White suspects; faster decisions not to shoot unarmed White suspects than unarmed Black suspects

2. **Errors**: More frequent mistakes shooting unarmed Black suspects and not shooting armed White suspects

Disturbingly, both Black and White participants show similar levels of shooter bias. Even police officers, while better at detecting weapons and not showing bias in accuracy, still show significant bias in response time.

The key finding: Familiarity with cultural stereotypes (that Black men are dangerous) predicted bias better than personal prejudice. Even people who don't personally endorse racist beliefs are influenced by stereotypes they've absorbed from the culture.

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid

**"Helping is just about being a good person"**: The bystander effect shows that situational factors often override personality. Good people fail to help in groups due to diffusion of responsibility.

**"More witnesses means more safety"**: Exactly backward. Victims are safest when there's only one bystander.

**"Prejudice is mostly about bad individuals"**: Modern racism operates at structural and institutional levels. Focusing only on individual attitudes misses systemic discrimination.

**"Benevolent sexism is better than hostile sexism"**: Both maintain gender inequality. "Protecting" women from challenges keeps them from positions of power.

**"Colorblind approaches reduce racism"**: Ignoring race doesn't address structural inequalities or heal from racial trauma. Multicultural approaches that acknowledge and value differences are more effective.

**"People who say they're not racist are telling the truth"**: Aversive racism shows people can genuinely believe they're unprejudiced while harboring unconscious biases that affect their behavior.

## Memory Tips for the EPPP

**For the five-step bystander intervention model**: Think "NIRAΔ" (Notice, Interpret, Responsibility, Able, Decide). Or use the phrase "**N**ice **I**deas **R**equire **A**ction **D**aily"

**For types of covert racism**: **SAA**. Symbolic, Aversive, Ambivalent

**For contact hypothesis conditions**: **ECNA**. Equal status, Common goals, No competition, Authority support

**For levels of racism**: **SIIII**. Structural, Institutional, Interpersonal, Internalized (four I's after the S)

**For ambivalent sexism**: Think "H&B" like a hardware store. **H**ostile and **B**enevolent work together to maintain the structure

**Shooter bias studies**: Remember that cultural stereotype exposure matters MORE than personal prejudice. This counterintuitive finding often appears on exams

**Jigsaw classroom vs. superordinate goals**: Both involve cooperation, but jigsaw is the classroom application requiring individual expertise

## Key Takeaways

- **Bystander apathy increases with more witnesses** due to diffusion of responsibility, pluralistic ignorance, and evaluation apprehension
- **Helping is most likely with one bystander**, in rural settings, and when people are motivated by altruism rather than egoism
- **Superordinate goals** (requiring cooperation to achieve) effectively reduce intergroup conflict
- **Six major theories explain prejudice**: realistic conflict, social identity, scapegoat, authoritarian personality, terror management, and dehumanization
- **Contact hypothesis**: Equal status, common goals, no competition, and institutional support make intergroup contact effective
- **Covert racism** (symbolic, aversive, ambivalent) persists even when people endorse egalitarian values
- **Four levels of racism**: structural, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized. All require different interventions
- **Ambivalent sexism** includes both hostile attitudes toward nontraditional women and benevolent attitudes toward traditional women
- **Stereotype threat** impairs performance by consuming cognitive resources with anxiety and self-monitoring
- **Shooter bias** reflects cultural stereotype exposure more than personal prejudice and affects both civilians and police officers

Understanding these concepts prepares you not just for exam questions, but for recognizing these patterns in real clinical and organizational settings. You'll see bystander effects in group therapy, stereotype threat affecting your clients' performance, and various forms of racism impacting mental health. This knowledge transforms from abstract theory into practical tools for making sense of human behavior.
