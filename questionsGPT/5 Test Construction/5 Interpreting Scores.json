      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The percentage of individuals in the reference group who scored at or below an examinee's score,\" accurately defines a percentile rank. Percentile ranks indicate how an examinee's score compares to others in the standardization sample, reflecting the proportion of examinees who scored equal to or lower than the given score. For example, a percentile rank of 82 means that 82% of the reference group scored at or below that score, highlighting the relative standing of the examinee.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- \"The number of standard deviations an individual's score is from the mean\" is incorrect because this describes a z-score, which quantifies how far a score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations, rather than comparing it to a reference group.\n  \n- \"The proportion of test items answered correctly by an examinee\" is incorrect because this defines a percentage score, which measures the correctness of responses rather than how an examinee's score relates to others in the reference group.\n\n- \"The expected score on a criterion measure based on an obtained predictor score\" is incorrect because this describes an expectancy table, which predicts future performance based on a test score, rather than indicating the relative standing of an examinee's score within a reference group.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The examinee scored 1 standard deviation below the mean,\" is accurate because T-scores are standardized scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. A T-score of 40 indicates that the examinee's score is one standard deviation below the mean (50 - 10 = 40).\n\n2. The option \"The examinee scored 0.5 standard deviations below the mean\" is incorrect because a T-score of 45 would represent 0.5 standard deviations below the mean, not 40. The option \"The examinee scored 1 standard deviation above the mean\" is wrong because a T-score of 60 would indicate one standard deviation above the mean, not 40.

      "explanation": "1. The correct statement, \"Stanines range from 1 to 9, with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2, representing roughly half a standard deviation per unit except for extremes,\" accurately describes stanines as they are defined in the reference material. Stanines are a standardized scoring system where each unit represents approximately half a standard deviation around the mean, which is set at 5, with the range of scores being from 1 to 9. This structure allows for a clear interpretation of an examinee's performance relative to a reference group.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Stanines are scores scaled to have a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15, used mainly for IQ tests,\" is wrong because stanines do not have a mean of 100 or a standard deviation of 15; those characteristics apply to IQ scores, not stanines. The second incorrect option, \"Stanines have a mean of 50 and SD of 10 and are identical to T-scores,\" is incorrect because stanines have a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2, which distinguishes them from T-scores, which indeed have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Lastly, the statement \"Stanines represent the percentage of test items an examinee answered correctly\" is incorrect because stanines are not percentage scores; they are a ranking system that categorizes performance into nine distinct levels rather than directly measuring the proportion of correct responses.",

The correct answer, \"When determining if an examinee has achieved mastery of specific content based on a pre-established cutoff,\" is appropriate because criterion-referenced scores are specifically designed to evaluate an individual's competence or mastery of a skill against a predetermined standard. This approach focuses on whether the examinee meets a specific level of performance, rather than comparing their score to others, which is the primary goal of norm-referenced scores.\n\n2. The option \"When comparing an individual's test score to the performance of a normative group\" is incorrect because this describes the use of norm-referenced scores, which assess how an examinee's performance compares to a reference group rather than measuring mastery against a standard. The option \"When ranking a group of candidates from highest to lowest to select the top performers\" is wrong because ranking involves norm-referenced scoring, where individuals are compared against one another, rather than assessing mastery of specific content. Lastly, the option \"When converting raw scores into z-scores to determine relative standing\" is incorrect as this process pertains to transforming raw scores into standard scores for norm-referenced interpretation, rather than evaluating mastery based on a criterion.",

The correct answer, \"Grouping scores into ranges based on the test's standard error of measurement and considering all candidates within a band equivalent,\" accurately characterizes banding because it reflects the principle that small differences in test scores may arise from measurement unreliability. Banding treats candidates with scores within the same range as equivalent, allowing for selection based on additional factors beyond test scores, thereby addressing potential adverse impact and promoting fairness in the selection process.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Grouping test scores into ranks from highest to lowest and selecting top candidates accordingly,\" misrepresents banding, as it does not involve ranking but rather grouping scores into bands. The second incorrect option, \"Setting a score cutoff and accepting any candidates who exceed it,\" is incorrect because banding does not rely on a strict cutoff score; instead, it considers ranges of scores. Lastly, the option \"Selecting candidates solely based on their exact test score differences\" is wrong because banding emphasizes the equivalence of scores within a band rather than making decisions based on precise score differences, which could overlook other important candidate attributes.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer states that \"Expectancy tables show the distribution of criterion scores for each predictor score, whereas regression equations predict a single criterion score.\" This is accurate because expectancy tables provide a breakdown of how different test scores (predictor scores) correlate with various performance outcomes (criterion scores) in a distribution format. In contrast, regression equations generate a specific predicted value for a criterion score based on a given predictor score, focusing on a single outcome rather than a distribution.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Expectancy tables predict a single criterion score, whereas regression equations show the distribution of criterion scores for a given predictor score,\" is wrong because it reverses the functions of expectancy tables and regression equations; expectancy tables do not predict a single score but rather display a distribution. The second incorrect option, \"Expectancy tables assess ranking only, whereas regression equations are used for cutoff score setting,\" is incorrect because expectancy tables provide a distribution of scores rather than just ranking, and regression equations do not specifically relate to cutoff scores but predict outcomes. Lastly, the third incorrect option, \"Expectancy tables are used exclusively for criterion-referenced tests, while regression equations apply to norm-referenced tests,\" is misleading since both expectancy tables and regression equations can be used in various contexts, not limited to the type of test (norm-referenced or criterion-referenced).",

      ],
      "answer": "The score is one standard deviation below the mean",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The score is one standard deviation below the mean,\" is accurate because full-scale IQ scores on the Wechsler tests have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. A score of 85 is calculated as one standard deviation below the mean (100 - 15 = 85), confirming that the individual\u2019s performance is lower than the average population score.\n\n2. The option \"The score is one standard deviation above the mean\" is incorrect because a score of 85 is lower than the mean of 100, not higher. The statement \"The score is equal to the population mean\" is wrong because 85 does not equal 100, which is the mean IQ score for the Wechsler tests. Lastly, \"The score is two standard deviations below the mean\" is incorrect because a score of 85 is only one standard deviation below the mean, which would correspond to a score of 70 (100 - 30 = 70) if it were two standard deviations below.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Because each percentile rank corresponds to exactly 1% of scores, resulting in a uniform distribution,\" is accurate because percentile ranks are assigned in a way that each rank represents a fixed percentage (1%) of the total scores. This creates a rectangular or flat distribution, regardless of the actual shape of the raw score distribution, as the highest 1% of scores is ranked 100, the next highest 1% is ranked 99, and so forth. This non-linear transformation contrasts with standard scores, which maintain the shape of the raw score distribution.\n\n2. The option \"Because percentile ranks represent equal intervals of raw scores\" is incorrect because percentile ranks do not represent equal intervals; they are based on the relative standing of scores within the distribution rather than fixed score differences. The statement \"Because the shape of the raw score distribution is preserved in percentile ranks\" is inaccurate since percentile ranks do not preserve the shape of the raw score distribution; they create a uniform distribution instead.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"That small score differences within a band are due to measurement error rather than meaningful differences,\" reflects the foundational assumption of banding in selection techniques. Banding posits that minor variations in test scores may not accurately reflect true differences in ability due to the inherent unreliability of the test. Therefore, candidates with scores that fall within the same band are considered equivalent, allowing for a more equitable selection process that accounts for potential measurement errors.\n\n2. The option \"That all scores within a band represent identical true ability levels\" is incorrect because banding acknowledges that while scores within a band are treated as equivalent, they may not reflect identical true abilities; rather, they are seen as potentially influenced by measurement error. The statement \"That higher raw scores always indicate superior ability regardless of error\" is wrong because banding specifically addresses the unreliability of test scores, suggesting that not all higher scores are indicative of true ability due to possible measurement error.

        "The examinee scored 1.5 standard deviations below the mean",
        "The examinee scored 2 standard deviations below the mean",
        "The examinee scored 1 standard deviation below the mean",
        "The examinee scored 2.5 standard deviations below the mean"
      ],
      "answer": "The examinee scored 2 standard deviations below the mean",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The examinee scored 2 standard deviations below the mean,\" is accurate because T-scores have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Therefore, a T-score of 30 is calculated as follows: (30 - 50) / 10 = -2, indicating that the examinee is 2 standard deviations below the mean.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- \"The examinee scored 1.5 standard deviations below the mean\" is incorrect because a T-score of 30 is not 15 points below the mean of 50, which would be the case for a 1.5 standard deviation difference (45).\n- \"The examinee scored 1 standard deviation below the mean\" is wrong because a T-score of 40 (50 - 10) would represent a score that is 1 standard deviation below the mean, not 30.\n- \"The examinee scored 2.5 standard deviations below the mean\" is incorrect as a T-score of 25 (50 - 2.5 * 10) would indicate a score that is 2.5 standard deviations below the mean, not 30.",
