      ],
      "answer": "General Occupational Themes (GOTs)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"General Occupational Themes (GOTs)\" because this scale of the Strong Interest Inventory (SII) specifically provides scores based on Holland's six occupational themes, which include realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, and conventional. This allows examinees to understand their interests in relation to these established categories of occupations.\n\n2. The \"Basic Interest Scales (BISs)\" are incorrect because they provide scores on 30 specific interests that represent the six occupational themes, rather than directly scoring on the themes themselves. The \"Occupational Scales (OSs)\" are also incorrect as they indicate the similarity of the examinee's interests to those of individuals in specific occupations, rather than categorizing them into Holland's themes. Lastly, the \"Personal Styles Scales (PSSs)\" are incorrect because they focus on the examinee\u2019s preferences regarding personal work styles and environments, rather than on the occupational themes defined by Holland.",

      "answer": "Ipsative scoring",
      "explanation": "1. **Ipsative scoring** is the correct answer for the Kuder Occupational Interest Survey (KOIS) because the test employs a forced-choice format where examinees select their most and least preferred activities from sets of three options. This method yields ipsative scores that allow for comparisons of an individual's preferences within themselves, rather than against a normative group, which is characteristic of ipsative scoring.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- **Norm-referenced scoring** compares an individual's scores to a normative sample, which is not applicable in the KOIS due to its ipsative nature that focuses on individual preferences rather than group comparisons.\n  \n- **Criterion-referenced scoring** evaluates an individual's performance against a specific criterion or standard, rather than comparing preferences within the individual, which does not align with the KOIS's forced-choice design.\n  \n- **Percentile scoring** indicates the percentage of scores in a normative sample that fall below a given score, which is not relevant for the KOIS as it does not provide comparisons to a normative group but rather focuses on intra-individual comparisons.",

The PSSs specifically evaluate preferences related to work style, leadership style, learning environment, risk taking, and team orientation, but do not include work-life balance as a category.\n\n2. \n- **Leadership style** is incorrect because it is one of the five personal styles specifically measured by the PSSs in the SII, assessing how individuals prefer to lead and manage in work settings.\n- **Risk taking** is incorrect as it is also included in the PSSs, measuring how comfortable individuals are with taking risks in their personal and professional lives.\n- **Team orientation** is incorrect because it is another personal style assessed by the PSSs, focusing on an individual's preference for working collaboratively within teams versus independently.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"By comparing responses of employed individuals to a representative adult sample (empirical criterion keying),\" is accurate because the Occupational Scales (OSs) of the Strong Interest Inventory (SII) were constructed using empirical criterion keying. This method involved analyzing the responses of men and women in various occupations and comparing them to a general representative sample of employed adults, allowing for the identification of items that effectively distinguished between different occupational preferences.\n\n2. The option \"Using factor analysis of interest items across occupations\" is incorrect because the SII did not utilize factor analysis for the construction of the OSs; rather, it relied on empirical criterion keying. The option \"Through expert consensus on occupational traits\" is wrong because the development of the OSs was not based on expert opinions but rather on empirical data from actual occupational groups.

      "explanation": "1. The statement \"The SII provides normative scores allowing inter-individual comparisons, while the KOIS provides ipsative scores allowing only intra-individual comparisons\" is correct because the Strong Interest Inventory (SII) uses empirical criterion keying to generate scores that can be compared across individuals, making it suitable for normative assessments.

The option \"Only the KOIS uses a Likert-type scale for responses\" is incorrect because the SII, not the KOIS, uses a five-point Likert-type scale for its 291 items, while the KOIS uses a forced-choice format. The statement \"The SII is designed exclusively for adults, while the KOIS is only for high school students\" is misleading since both inventories are intended for high school students and adults, with the SII also being appropriate for college students.

      "answer": "It offers age-appropriate career exploration programs ranging from pre-K through adulthood",

The statement \"It offers age-appropriate career exploration programs ranging from pre-K through adulthood\" is correct because the Kuder Career Planning System (KCPS) provides tailored programs for different age groups, including Kuder Galaxy for pre-K to grade 5, Kuder Navigator for grades 6 through 12, and Kuder Journey for college students and adults. This structured approach ensures that each program is developmentally appropriate and meets the specific needs of users at various educational stages.\n\n2.

The option \"To measure the desire for stable employment positions\" is incorrect because the Dependability Indices do not assess employment desires but rather focus on the reliability of the responses given.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"It limits the ability to compare scores between individuals, restricting normative interpretation,\" accurately describes a limitation of ipsative scoring used in the Kuder Occupational Interest Survey (KOIS). Ipsative scoring means that scores are relative to an individual's own preferences rather than compared to a normative sample, making it impossible to determine how one individual\u2019s scores stack up against another\u2019s. This restricts the ability to draw broad conclusions about how an examinee's interests compare to others, limiting normative interpretation of the results.\n\n2. The option \"It allows for reliable inter-individual comparisons but not intra-individual comparisons\" is incorrect because ipsative scoring specifically does not support inter-individual comparisons; it only allows for comparisons within an individual\u2019s own responses. The statement \"It provides trait-level scores that are directly comparable across populations\" is wrong because ipsative scoring does not yield scores that are comparable across different individuals or groups, as it is based on individual preferences rather than normative data.

This means that the BISs break down broader themes into more nuanced areas of interest, allowing for a detailed assessment of an individual's preferences within those themes.\n\n2. The option \"Broad occupational themes such as realistic or social interests\" is incorrect because the BISs focus on specific interests rather than the overarching themes themselves.
