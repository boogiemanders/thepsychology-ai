      ],
      "answer": "Fluid intelligence peaks earliest, typically between 30 and 40 years old.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Fluid intelligence peaks earliest, typically between 30 and 40 years old,\" aligns with Horn and Cattell's theory, which distinguishes between two types of intelligence: fluid and crystallized. Fluid intelligence (Gf) represents the inherent capacity to learn and solve novel problems, and research indicates that it reaches its peak in early adulthood, specifically between the ages of 30 and 40.\n\n2. The option \"Crystallized intelligence peaks earliest, typically between 30 and 40 years old\" is incorrect because crystallized intelligence (Gc) is dependent on prior learning and experience and does not peak until later in life, around 60 to 70 years old. The option \"Crystallized intelligence peaks earliest, typically between 60 and 70 years old\" is misleading as it inaccurately suggests that this is the earliest peak, while it is actually the correct age range for crystallized intelligence. Lastly, the option \"Fluid intelligence peaks earliest, typically between 60 and 70 years old\" is incorrect since fluid intelligence actually peaks much earlier, and by that age, it typically begins to decline.",

      "answer": "Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, 5th Edition",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test, 5th Edition\" because the CHC theory, which combines elements of Horn-Cattell and Carroll theories, explicitly influenced its development. The SB5 is based on a hierarchical general mental ability model that incorporates five cognitive factors derived from the CHC theory, making it a direct application of this theoretical framework.\n\n2. The \"Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd Edition\" is incorrect because, although it is based on a hierarchical model of intelligence, it is not explicitly identified as being influenced by the CHC theory, unlike its more recent versions. \"Raven's Progressive Matrices\" is also incorrect as it primarily measures fluid intelligence without a direct connection to the CHC theory's broader cognitive abilities framework.

      "answer": "Visual processing (Gv)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Visual processing (Gv),\" is accurate because the Visual Spatial Index (VSI) of the WISC-V specifically assesses an individual's ability to visualize and manipulate spatial relationships and visual information. This ability is integral to tasks that require understanding and processing visual stimuli, which aligns directly with the definition of visual processing.\n\n2. The option \"Short-term memory (Gsm)\" is incorrect because short-term memory refers to the ability to temporarily hold and manipulate information, which is assessed by the Working Memory Index (WMI) of the WISC-V, not the VSI. \"Crystallized intelligence (Gc)\" is also wrong, as crystallized intelligence involves the application of acquired knowledge and skills, typically assessed by the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), rather than visual processing. Lastly, \"Processing speed (Gs)\" is incorrect because processing speed pertains to the efficiency of cognitive operations and is measured by the Processing Speed Index (PSI), not the VSI, which focuses specifically on visual spatial abilities.",

      ],
      "answer": "IQ scores tend to increase by about 3 points per decade, so older norms may inflate scores.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer states that \"IQ scores tend to increase by about 3 points per decade, so older norms may inflate scores\" because research, particularly by Flynn (1987, 1998), has shown a consistent rise in IQ scores over time across various populations. This phenomenon, known as the Flynn Effect, indicates that individuals tested on older IQ tests with outdated norms may receive higher scores than they would on newer tests that reflect the current population's performance, leading to an inflation of their IQ scores when compared to contemporary norms.\n\n2. The option \"IQ scores tend to decrease over time, so older norms may deflate scores\" is incorrect because the Flynn Effect specifically documents an increase in scores rather than a decrease. The statement \"There is no systematic difference in IQ scores across different test norms\" is wrong because the Flynn Effect demonstrates a clear trend of increasing scores over decades, indicating a systematic difference. Lastly, the option \"Older test norms systematically bias scores downward due to cultural changes\" is incorrect as it contradicts the Flynn Effect, which illustrates that older norms typically lead to inflated scores rather than a downward bias.",

      ],
      "answer": "Processing Speed Index (PSI)",
      "explanation": "1. The **Processing Speed Index (PSI)** is the correct answer because research indicates that this index begins to decline around age 30 and experiences the greatest age-related decline compared to other indices on the WAIS-IV. The PSI assesses how quickly and accurately an individual can process information, which tends to diminish with age due to factors such as cognitive slowing and decreased processing efficiency.\n\n2. The **Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI)** is incorrect because it shows the least decline over time, remaining stable until about age 80, as it primarily assesses crystallized intelligence. The **Working Memory Index (WMI)** is also incorrect because it remains relatively stable until around age 60, after which it begins to decline, but not as significantly as the PSI. Lastly, the **General Ability Index (GAI)** is incorrect because it is derived from the VCI and Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), both of which do not exhibit the same level of decline as the PSI, particularly because the GAI minimizes the effects of working memory and processing speed.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) significantly higher than Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI),\" is characteristic of individuals with nonverbal learning disability (NVLD). This pattern indicates that the individual has strong verbal skills while struggling with nonverbal reasoning and visual-spatial tasks, which is a hallmark of NVLD. Research indicates that a significant discrepancy between VCI and PRI scores is commonly observed in individuals with NVLD, reflecting their difficulties with nonverbal communication and mathematical concepts.\n\n2. The option \"Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) significantly higher than Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI)\" is incorrect because it suggests stronger nonverbal reasoning abilities, which is contrary to the profile seen in NVLD. The option \"Processing Speed Index (PSI) significantly higher than Working Memory Index (WMI)\" is also incorrect, as NVLD typically does not show a pattern where processing speed is stronger than working memory; instead, both may be affected. Lastly, \"Working Memory Index (WMI) significantly higher than Processing Speed Index (PSI)\" is incorrect because NVLD is not characterized by a stronger working memory in comparison to processing speed, and individuals with NVLD often have discrepancies that do not favor working memory over processing speed.",

      "explanation": "1. \"Das, Naglieri, and Kirby's PASS theory\" is the correct answer because it specifically identifies four interdependent functions of intelligence: planning, attention, simultaneous processing, and sequential processing. This theory is rooted in Luria's research on cognitive functions and emphasizes how these functions interact with a person's knowledge to facilitate intelligent behavior.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows: \n- **Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences** focuses on the existence of multiple distinct intelligences that vary in strength among individuals, rather than interdependent cognitive functions.\n- **Sternberg's Triarchic Theory of Successful Intelligence** comprises three components\u2014analytical, creative, and practical intelligence\u2014rather than the four functions outlined in the PASS theory.\n- **Spearman's Two-Factor Theory** distinguishes between a general intelligence factor (g) and specific factors (s) affecting performance on cognitive tasks, without addressing the specific functions of planning, attention, simultaneous processing, and sequential processing.",

The correct answer is the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) because, for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without language impairment, the VCI typically reflects their ability to utilize verbal skills and knowledge effectively. Research indicates that these children often perform better on verbal tasks compared to nonverbal tasks, leading to a higher VCI score relative to other indexes.\n\n2. The Processing Speed Index (PSI) is incorrect because children with ASD tend to show slower processing speeds, which often results in lower scores on this index. The Fluid Reasoning Index (FRI) is not the highest for this group, as it assesses the ability to solve novel problems and is typically lower for children with ASD who may struggle with such tasks.

      "answer": "Fluid intelligence",
      "explanation": "1. **Fluid intelligence** is the correct answer because it represents the inherent capacity to learn and reason, allowing individuals to solve new problems and think abstractly without relying on prior knowledge or experiences. As described in Horn and Cattell's theory, fluid intelligence (Gf) is crucial for tasks that involve forming concepts, drawing inferences, and solving unfamiliar problems, distinguishing it from other types of intelligence.\n\n2. **Crystallized intelligence** is incorrect because it depends on prior learning and experiences, involving the application of acquired knowledge and skills, such as vocabulary and factual recall. **Emotional intelligence** is also incorrect as it pertains to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions in oneself and others, rather than cognitive reasoning or problem-solving abilities. Lastly, **social intelligence** is incorrect because it refers to the ability to navigate social situations and understand social dynamics, which does not specifically relate to reasoning or solving new problems independently of prior knowledge.",

        "Crystallized intelligence tends to decline steadily after early adulthood.",

      ],
      "answer": "Crystallized intelligence remains stable and can increase with age.",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Crystallized intelligence remains stable and can increase with age\" is correct because, according to Horn and Cattell's theory, crystallized intelligence (Gc) is dependent on prior learning and experiences, which accumulate over time. Research indicates that crystallized intelligence continues to develop, peaking around the ages of 60 to 70, and remains relatively stable throughout adulthood.\n\n2. The option \"Crystallized intelligence tends to decline steadily after early adulthood\" is incorrect because crystallized intelligence does not show a decline until much later in life, typically after it has peaked. The statement \"Crystallized intelligence peaks in childhood and then declines\" is also wrong, as crystallized intelligence actually peaks in later adulthood, not childhood. Lastly, the option \"Crystallized intelligence is independent of age and remains constant\" is misleading because it ignores the fact that crystallized intelligence can increase with age due to accumulated knowledge and experience, rather than remaining constant.",
