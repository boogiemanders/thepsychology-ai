      "explanation": "1. The \"Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF)\" is the correct answer because it was developed by Cattell using the lexical strategy, which posits that important personality traits are encoded in language. Cattell employed factor analysis to distill a large number of personality descriptors into 16 primary traits and five broader global traits, effectively identifying both specific and overarching aspects of personality.\n\n2. The \"NEO Personality Inventory-3 (NEO-PI-3)\" is incorrect because, while it also uses a lexical approach and factor analysis, it focuses specifically on the Big Five personality traits rather than identifying a broader range of primary and global traits like the 16 PF. The \"Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)\" is wrong because it is based on Jung\u2019s personality typology and identifies personality types through four bipolar dimensions, rather than deriving traits from language and factor analysis. Lastly, the \"Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS)\" is incorrect as it assesses basic needs through a forced-choice format, focusing on relative strengths of needs rather than employing factor analysis to identify personality traits.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Ipsative scoring, which allows intra-individual but not inter-individual comparisons\" because the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) uses a forced-choice format that yields ipsative scores. This means that the scores reflect the relative strength of an individual's needs by comparing choices made within the test but do not provide absolute measures that can be compared across different individuals, thus limiting inter-individual comparisons.\n\n2. The option \"Norm-referenced scoring, which allows extensive inter-individual comparisons\" is incorrect because norm-referenced scoring involves comparing an individual's score to a normative sample, which the EPPS does not provide. \"Criterion-referenced scoring, which compares examinees to fixed standards\" is also incorrect as the EPPS does not assess performance against fixed criteria but rather focuses on relative preferences. Lastly, \"Raw scores, which directly reflect absolute strength of needs\" is incorrect because the EPPS does not generate raw scores that indicate absolute strengths; instead, it produces ipsative scores that only suggest relative strengths of needs within the individual.",

The \"Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)\" is incorrect because it involves storytelling based on pictures, not inkblots, and focuses on the narratives created by the examinee rather than their perceptions of ambiguous stimuli. The \"Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS)\" is also incorrect as it assesses basic human needs through a forced-choice format with statements, rather than using ambiguous inkblots for projection.

The correct answer, \"Emotionality and impulsiveness,\" is supported by the Exner Comprehensive System for the Rorschach Inkblot Test, which indicates that a high number of color responses reflects an examinee's emotional state and tendency toward impulsive behavior. Color responses are interpreted as indicative of strong feelings and emotional reactions, suggesting that the individual may experience emotions intensely and act on them without much restraint.\n\n2. The option \"Creative or theoretical thinking\" is incorrect because high color responses do not specifically correlate with creativity or abstract thought; instead, they are more aligned with emotional expression. \"Brain injury or cognitive impairment\" is also misleading, as such conditions are typically indicated by confabulation or unusual response patterns rather than merely a high number of color responses. Lastly, \"Social conformity and realism\" does not fit because high color responses suggest emotional expression rather than adherence to social norms or realistic thinking; these responses reflect personal emotional experiences rather than conformity.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"They present unstructured, ambiguous stimuli to elicit projections of personality,\" accurately describes projective personality tests because these tests operate on the assumption that individuals will project their personalities when presented with ambiguous stimuli. For example, in the Rorschach Inkblot Test, examinees interpret inkblots that lack clear meaning, allowing their responses to reveal underlying thoughts, feelings, and personality traits.\n\n2. The option \"They use direct self-report items with objective, non-ambiguous wording\" is incorrect because this characteristic describes structured personality tests, not projective tests. The statement \"They score examinees based on their absolute levels of traits relative to norms\" is misleading since projective tests do not provide absolute scores but rather interpret responses qualitatively.

The correct answer, \"A lexical hypothesis where language encodes fundamental personality traits identified by factor analysis,\" accurately describes the theoretical model of the 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF) because it was developed by Cattell using a lexical strategy to identify personality traits.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Ipsative scores prevent valid comparisons between different individuals because they indicate relative, not absolute, trait strength,\" accurately reflects the nature of ipsative scoring used in the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS). In this format, examinees choose between two statements that assess different needs, resulting in scores that reflect the relative strength of their needs compared to one another.

The first incorrect option, \"Ipsative scores are norm-based and require large sample sizes for accurate interpretation,\" is wrong because ipsative scoring does not rely on normative data; rather, it focuses on an individual's relative preferences, making norms irrelevant. The second incorrect option, \"Ipsative scoring inflates inter-individual variability and undermines reliability,\" is incorrect because ipsative scores do not inflate variability; they limit the ability to make inter-individual comparisons, which does not inherently affect reliability.
