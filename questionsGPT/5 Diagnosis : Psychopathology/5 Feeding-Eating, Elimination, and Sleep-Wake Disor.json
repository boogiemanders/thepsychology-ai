      ],
      "answer": "Excessive valuation of physical appearance and weight",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Excessive valuation of physical appearance and weight,\" is accurate because transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral therapy-enhanced (CBT-E) for eating disorders is based on the premise that these disorders share a core psychopathology of placing disproportionate importance on physical appearance and weight. This excessive valuation leads to maladaptive behaviors related to eating and body image, which CBT-E aims to address by focusing on the factors maintaining an individual's symptoms.\n\n2. The option \"Distorted body image and lack of awareness of weight status\" is incorrect because, while these factors may be present in some eating disorders, they do not encompass the broader psychopathology targeted by CBT-E, which focuses on valuation rather than just perception. \"Compulsive need for control over food and emotions\" is not the core psychopathology of eating disorders as defined by CBT-E; instead, it reflects specific behaviors that may arise from the underlying valuation issues. Lastly, \"An intense fear of food and social eating situations\" is also incorrect because, while fear can be a symptom in disorders like anorexia and bulimia, it does not capture the central theme of excessive valuation of appearance and weight that CBT-E addresses across various eating disorders.",

      "answer": "Moisture alarm (bell-and-pad)",
      "explanation": "1. The \"moisture alarm (bell-and-pad)\" is the correct answer because it is the most common treatment for nocturnal enuresis, which involves repeated involuntary urination during sleep. This method effectively helps children learn to wake up when they begin to urinate, thereby promoting bladder control and reducing bedwetting episodes.\n\n2. **Behavioral dry-bed training:** This approach may involve various behavioral strategies to encourage dry nights, but it is not as effective or commonly recommended as the moisture alarm for nocturnal enuresis. \n\n   **Imipramine medication:** While imipramine has been used for treating enuresis, it is not considered a first-line treatment due to potential side effects and the availability of more effective non-pharmacological options like the moisture alarm.\n\n   **Desmopressin monotherapy:** Although desmopressin can reduce or stop bedwetting, it is associated with a high risk of relapse when discontinued and is not the first-line treatment compared to the moisture alarm method.",

The correct answer, \"Electrolyte imbalance leading to cardiac arrhythmias,\" is directly associated with the compensatory behaviors seen in bulimia nervosa, particularly self-induced vomiting and excessive exercise. These behaviors can result in significant fluid loss and electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to serious medical complications such as cardiac arrhythmias due to the heart's reliance on proper electrolyte levels for maintaining normal rhythm and function.\n\n2. The option \"Severe malnutrition affecting all major organ systems\" is incorrect because, while malnutrition can occur in bulimia nervosa, it is more characteristic of anorexia nervosa, where energy intake is severely restricted. \"Intestinal obstruction and lead poisoning\" is incorrect as these complications are primarily related to pica, which involves the ingestion of non-nutritive substances, rather than the behaviors associated with bulimia nervosa. Lastly, \"Osteoporosis from prolonged calcium deficiency\" is incorrect because, while individuals with eating disorders may experience bone density loss, it is more closely linked to anorexia nervosa and prolonged malnutrition rather than the compensatory behaviors specific to bulimia nervosa.",

      "answer": "Presence of excessive compensatory behavior",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Presence of excessive compensatory behavior,\" differentiates binge-eating disorder (BED) from bulimia nervosa because individuals with bulimia engage in recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise) to prevent weight gain after binge eating. In contrast, those with BED do not engage in these compensatory behaviors, which is a key diagnostic criterion that distinguishes the two disorders.\n\n2. \n- **Frequency of binge episodes occurring at least once a week for three months:** This criterion applies to both BED and bulimia nervosa, making it insufficient to differentiate between the two disorders.\n- **Sense of lack of control during eating episodes:** Both BED and bulimia nervosa involve a sense of lack of control during binge eating episodes, so this feature does not serve as a distinguishing factor.\n- **Onset of dysfunctional dieting prior to binge episodes:** While dysfunctional dieting often precedes bulimia nervosa, it is not a defining characteristic of BED, which can occur after dieting has started. Thus, this option does not accurately differentiate the two disorders.",

      "answer": "Stimulus control",
      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Stimulus control**  \n\"Stimulus control\" is the correct answer because it is a key component of cognitive-behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) that focuses on strengthening the bed and bedroom as cues for sleep. This is achieved by encouraging individuals to associate their bed with sleep rather than wakefulness, which involves practices such as going to bed only when tired and using the bed solely for sleep.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Cognitive restructuring:** This component involves identifying and replacing negative thoughts and beliefs that contribute to insomnia, but it does not specifically target the environmental cues associated with sleep.\n- **Sleep hygiene training:** While this component provides education about behaviors that facilitate or interfere with sleep, it does not directly focus on strengthening the bed and bedroom as cues for sleep.\n- **Sleep restriction:** This technique aims to improve sleep efficiency by limiting the time spent in bed to the amount of time a person typically sleeps, but it does not enhance the association between the bed and sleep.",

      "answer": "Recurrent episodes of cataplexy triggered by strong emotions",
      "explanation": "1. The hallmark characteristic of narcolepsy that differentiates it from other sleep-wake disorders is the presence of recurrent episodes of cataplexy, which involves a sudden loss of muscle tone often triggered by strong emotions. This symptom is unique to narcolepsy and differentiates it from other disorders, as cataplexy is not typically associated with conditions like insomnia or sleep apnea. Additionally, narcolepsy is characterized by an irrepressible need to sleep and can include other features such as hallucinations and sleep paralysis, but cataplexy remains a defining feature.\n\n2. The option \"Episodes of early morning awakening with difficulty returning to sleep\" is incorrect because this symptom is associated with insomnia disorder, which involves dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity rather than cataplexy. \"Prolonged difficulty maintaining sleep throughout the night\" is also incorrect as it pertains to sleep maintenance insomnia, a common type of insomnia disorder, and does not involve the unique symptom of cataplexy. Finally, \"Repetitive involuntary urination during sleep\" is incorrect because it describes enuresis, an elimination disorder, and is unrelated to the characteristics of narcolepsy or its symptoms.",

      "answer": "Parents taking charge of nutritional rehabilitation and weight restoration",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Parents taking charge of nutritional rehabilitation and weight restoration,\" accurately reflects the primary focus of the first phase of family-based treatment (FBT) for adolescent anorexia nervosa. In this phase, parents are given the responsibility to oversee their child's nutritional rehabilitation and weight restoration with the support of the therapist, which is crucial for addressing the immediate health concerns associated with anorexia nervosa.\n\n2. The option \"Helping the adolescent develop age-appropriate independence regarding eating\" is incorrect because this aspect is addressed in later phases of FBT, not the first phase, which prioritizes parental control over nutritional rehabilitation. The option \"Addressing adolescent and family psychological issues\" is also incorrect, as the initial focus is primarily on nutritional and weight restoration rather than psychological issues, which are addressed in subsequent phases.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"maladaptive safety behaviors,\" refers to actions that individuals engage in to try to gain control over their sleep but ultimately exacerbate their insomnia. In this case, the patient's worry about the consequences of poor sleep and the act of frequently checking the clock are counterproductive strategies that increase anxiety and reinforce negative beliefs about sleep, thereby worsening their sleep difficulties.\n\n2. **Sleep hygiene violations:** This option is incorrect because sleep hygiene refers to practices that promote good sleep quality, such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule or creating a comfortable sleep environment; the patient's behaviors do not fall under this category. \n\n**Sleep restriction techniques:** This option is incorrect because sleep restriction is a component of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) designed to improve sleep efficiency by limiting time in bed to the actual amount of sleep; the patient's behaviors do not align with this therapeutic approach.\n\n**Stimulus control errors:** This option is incorrect because stimulus control involves establishing the bed and bedroom as cues for sleep, such as going to bed only when tired; the patient's behaviors of worrying and clock-checking do not reflect errors in this strategy but rather maladaptive attempts to manage anxiety about sleep.",

      "explanation": "1. \"Frequent inappropriate compensatory behaviors following binges\" is the correct answer because, unlike bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder (BED) does not involve any compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise to prevent weight gain. The diagnosis of BED is characterized solely by recurrent episodes of binge eating without these compensatory actions, which distinguishes it from other eating disorders.\n\n2. The option \"Episodes of binge eating occur at least once a week for three months\" is incorrect because this frequency is a key diagnostic criterion for BED, indicating the severity and persistence of the disorder. The statement \"At least three specific behavioral or emotional symptoms during binges\" is also incorrect, as the DSM-5-TR specifies that individuals must exhibit at least three out of five characteristic symptoms to meet the criteria for BED.

The option \"Anxiety disorders often emerge after recovery from anorexia nervosa\" is incorrect because the material does not support the idea that anxiety disorders typically develop following recovery; rather, they are often present before the onset of anorexia. The statement \"Anxiety disorders typically co-occur but are unrelated in onset\" is wrong because it implies that the two disorders are independent of each other, while the reference material emphasizes that anxiety often precedes anorexia.

This technology allows clinicians to objectively measure sleep stages and diagnose sleep-wake disorders, as it provides detailed information about the sleep architecture and any disturbances that may occur.\n\n**2. Explanation for Incorrect Options:**\n\n- **Actigraphy:** Actigraphy involves using a wrist-worn device to monitor movement patterns to estimate sleep-wake cycles, but it does not provide the detailed physiological data necessary for diagnosing specific sleep stages or disorders.\n\n- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** An electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart, which is not sufficient for assessing sleep stages or diagnosing sleep-wake disorders, as it does not capture brain activity or other sleep-related parameters.\n\n- **Functional MRI (fMRI):** While functional MRI is used to assess brain activity by measuring changes in blood flow, it is not typically employed in clinical settings for sleep studies, as it does not provide the necessary data on sleep stages or disturbances in a sleep context.",
