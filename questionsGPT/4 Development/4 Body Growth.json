      "answer": "Synaptic pruning",
      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Synaptic pruning**  \n\"Synaptic pruning\" is the correct answer because it refers to the process of eliminating unused synapses, which occurs throughout childhood and continues into adolescence. This process helps to refine neural connections, strengthening those that are frequently used while allowing those that are not to atrophy and disappear, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of brain function.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n\n- **Neurogenesis**: Neurogenesis is the process of producing new neurons, which primarily occurs in the hippocampus and does not involve the elimination of existing synapses.\n  \n- **Myelination**: Myelination refers to the growth of myelin around axons, which speeds up the transmission of nerve impulses, but it does not involve the elimination of synapses.\n\n- **Synaptogenesis**: Synaptogenesis is the formation of new synapses, particularly during early brain development, and is the opposite of synaptic pruning, which focuses on eliminating unused synapses.",

      "answer": "7 to 8 months",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"7 to 8 months\" because by this age, an infant's visual acuity improves significantly, allowing them to see at about 20 feet what normal adults can see at the same distance. This developmental milestone indicates that their vision has matured to levels comparable to that of adults, enabling better visual processing and interaction with their environment.\n\n2. The option \"At birth\" is incorrect because newborns have limited visual acuity, only able to see at about 20 feet what adults see at 400 to 600 feet. The option \"1 to 2 months\" is also wrong as infants at this age still prefer to look at their mothers' faces but have not yet developed adult-like visual acuity. Lastly, \"12 months\" is incorrect because by this age, infants have already achieved visual acuity similar to adults, making it an outdated response to the question regarding when this level is first reached.",

      "answer": "Pictorial (static-monocular) cues",
      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Pictorial (static-monocular) cues**  \nPictorial (static-monocular) cues are the type of depth information that infants begin using at about five to six months of age. These cues create the impression of depth through visual elements that can be perceived with one eye, such as size, texture gradients, shadows, and linear perspective, helping infants interpret their visual environment more effectively.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Kinetic cues:** Kinetic cues are based on the movement of objects and are utilized by infants starting as early as three or four weeks of age, not at five to six months.\n- **Binocular (stereoscopic) cues:** Binocular (stereoscopic) cues rely on the integration of images received by both eyes and begin to develop between two and three months of age, making them an earlier form of depth perception than pictorial cues.\n- **Motion parallax:** Motion parallax is a depth cue that involves the perception of depth based on the relative motion of objects as an observer moves, which is not specifically tied to the static, one-eyed images that pictorial cues represent.",

      ],
      "answer": "Decreased sensitivity to high-frequency sounds",
      "explanation": "1. \"Decreased sensitivity to high-frequency sounds\" is the correct answer because, around age 40, many adults begin to experience presbycusis, which is characterized by a decline in the ability to hear higher-frequency sounds. This decline makes it particularly difficult for individuals to understand voices of women and children, as well as softer consonants, which are typically higher in pitch.\n\n2. The option \"Decreased sensitivity to low-frequency sounds\" is incorrect because age-related hearing loss primarily affects high-frequency sounds, not low-frequency ones. \"Increased auditory localization abilities\" is wrong because, instead of improving, auditory localization typically diminishes in infants before re-emerging, and there is no indication that adults experience an increase in this ability with age. Lastly, \"Increased sensitivity to soft consonants\" is incorrect since the onset of presbycusis leads to decreased sensitivity, making it harder to hear softer sounds, including soft consonants, rather than increasing sensitivity to them.",

      "answer": "Presence of stepfather or maternal boyfriend in the home",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Presence of stepfather or maternal boyfriend in the home,\" is associated with an increased risk of early onset puberty in girls due to the influence of family dynamics and environmental stressors. Research indicates that such familial situations, characterized by instability or discord, can lead to earlier sexual maturation and developmental changes in girls (Ellis & Garber, 2000).\n\n2. The option \"Presence of biological father in the home\" is incorrect because having a biological father present is generally associated with stability and protective factors that may delay puberty rather than hasten it. \"High maternal education level\" is incorrect as higher maternal education often correlates with better parenting practices and stability, which can contribute to later onset puberty. Lastly, \"Later menarche in the mother\" is incorrect because if a mother experiences later menarche, it is typically associated with her daughter also experiencing later puberty, not earlier onset.",

      ],
      "answer": "The limbic system develops earlier than the prefrontal cortex, leading to emotion-driven decisions",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The limbic system develops earlier than the prefrontal cortex, leading to emotion-driven decisions,\" accurately reflects the findings in brain development research. During adolescence, the limbic system, which is involved in emotions and motivation, matures before the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for planning, decision-making, and impulse control. This developmental lag results in adolescents making decisions primarily based on emotional responses and pleasure rather than rational thought, increasing their risk for substance use and impulsive behaviors.\n\n2. The incorrect option \"The prefrontal cortex develops earlier than the limbic system, causing emotional immaturity\" is wrong because it misrepresents the timing of brain development, as the prefrontal cortex actually matures later than the limbic system. The statement \"Both the limbic system and prefrontal cortex develop fully before adolescence\" is incorrect because neither system is fully developed during this period; the prefrontal cortex continues to develop throughout adolescence. Lastly, the option \"The nucleus accumbens suppresses the reward circuit in adolescents\" is inaccurate because the nucleus accumbens is part of the reward circuit and is involved in enhancing the experience of pleasure rather than suppressing it, particularly during adolescence.",

      ],
      "answer": "Parental disapproval of substance use",
      "explanation": "1. \"Parental disapproval of substance use\" is the correct answer because it serves as a protective factor that can help deter adolescents from engaging in substance use. Research indicates that supportive parenting and clear disapproval of substance use can buffer the negative effects of risk factors, such as peer influence and mental health issues, thus promoting healthier choices among adolescents.\n\n2. The option \"Affiliation with substance-involved peers\" is incorrect because associating with peers who engage in substance use increases the likelihood of an adolescent using substances themselves, acting as a risk factor rather than a protective factor. \"Poor academic achievement\" is also incorrect, as it is a risk factor associated with higher rates of substance use, indicating that academic struggles can lead to increased vulnerability to substance abuse. Lastly, \"Exposure to stressful life events\" is wrong because such exposure is a known risk factor that can contribute to higher rates of substance use among adolescents, as it may lead to coping through substance use rather than providing any protective benefit.",

      "answer": "Walks with two hands held and then with one hand",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Walks with two hands held and then with one hand,\" aligns with the developmental milestones for children aged 10 to 12 months. During this period, infants typically begin to cruise (move along while holding onto furniture) and take independent steps, indicating significant progress in their gross motor skills as they develop greater balance and coordination.\n\n2. The option \"Sits without support steadily\" is incorrect because this milestone is typically achieved between 7 to 9 months of age, not 10 to 12 months. \"Hops on one foot two or three times\" is also incorrect, as this skill usually develops around 4 years of age. Lastly, \"Throws ball overhand 10 feet\" is incorrect because this ability is expected around 4 years as well, indicating more advanced motor skills than those expected at 10 to 12 months.",

      "answer": "Bed-sharing with the baby",
      "explanation": "1. \"Bed-sharing with the baby\" is the correct answer because it is identified as a factor that increases the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). The reference material explicitly states that unsafe sleep practices, including bed-sharing, can elevate the likelihood of SIDS, which involves the unexpected death of an infant during sleep.\n\n2. The option \"Having the baby sleep on his/her back\" is incorrect because placing infants on their backs to sleep is one of the recommended practices to reduce SIDS risk. \"Breastfeeding the baby\" is also incorrect, as breastfeeding has been shown to lower the risk of SIDS. Lastly, \"Keeping the crib as bare as possible\" is incorrect because a bare crib minimizes the risk of suffocation and is advised to reduce SIDS.",

      "answer": "Fraternal birth order effect",
      "explanation": "1. The \"fraternal birth order effect\" is the correct answer because research indicates that the likelihood of a boy being gay increases with each older brother born to the same mother. This phenomenon is explained by the maternal immune hypothesis, which suggests that mothers may become progressively immunized to male-specific antigens with each male fetus, impacting the sexual differentiation of the brain in subsequent male offspring.\n\n2. The option \"Having older sisters\" is incorrect because there is no established research linking the presence of older sisters to an increased likelihood of a boy having a gay sexual orientation; the effect is specifically associated with older brothers. \"Maternal smoking during pregnancy\" is also incorrect as it has not been shown to have a consistent relationship with sexual orientation; rather, it is more commonly linked to adverse health outcomes for the fetus. Lastly, \"Increased testosterone exposure prenatally\" is incorrect because while testosterone plays a role in sexual differentiation, studies have not consistently linked higher prenatal testosterone levels to an increased likelihood of a boy being gay.",

      "answer": "Changes in melatonin secretion delaying sleep onset",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Changes in melatonin secretion delaying sleep onset,\" is supported by research indicating that during adolescence, biological factors, particularly hormonal changes, lead to a delay in melatonin production. This delay results in adolescents having a natural inclination to fall asleep later, contributing significantly to chronic sleep deprivation.\n\n2. The option \"Early school start times\" is incorrect because, while it limits available time for sleep, it is categorized as a societal factor rather than a biological one. \"Increased academic pressures\" is also incorrect because it represents a psychosocial factor that affects sleep but does not directly influence biological sleep mechanisms. Lastly, \"Excessive screen time\" is not the correct answer because, although it can exacerbate sleep issues by suppressing melatonin production, it is primarily a behavioral factor rather than a biological one.",

According to the reference material, protective factors include parental disapproval of substance use and supportive parenting, which can buffer the adverse effects of stressful life events on a teen's likelihood of engaging in substance use.\n\n2. The option \"A teen with a history of depression and anxiety\" is incorrect because mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, are considered risk factors for substance abuse rather than protective factors. \"A teen affiliated with deviant peers using substances\" is wrong because association with deviant peers is a risk factor that increases the likelihood of substance use, not a protective factor.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Strengthening frequently used synaptic connections while eliminating unused ones,\" accurately describes the process of synaptic pruning. During brain development, synaptic pruning enhances efficiency by reinforcing connections that are actively used, making them stronger and more efficient, while simultaneously removing those that are not utilized, leading to a more streamlined and effective neural network.\n\n2. The option \"Generating new neurons in the hippocampus\" is incorrect because synaptic pruning specifically refers to the elimination of existing synapses rather than the creation of new neurons. \"Increasing myelination of all neurons equally\" is wrong as myelination enhances the speed of nerve impulse transmission but does not directly relate to the selective strengthening and elimination of synapses. Lastly, \"Maintaining a constant number of synapses throughout life\" is incorrect because synaptic pruning involves a dynamic process where the number of synapses decreases over time, particularly during childhood and adolescence, as unused connections are pruned away.",
