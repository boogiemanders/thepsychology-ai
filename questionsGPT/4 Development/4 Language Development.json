      ],
      "answer": "Language acquisition device (LAD)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Language acquisition device (LAD),\" is based on Chomsky's nativist theory, which posits that humans are biologically programmed to acquire language. The LAD is described as an inborn linguistic processor that allows children to understand language and speak according to grammatical rules, providing evidence for the universal stages of language acquisition that all children experience at similar ages.\n\n2. The option \"Social interactionist device\" is incorrect because social interactionist theory emphasizes the role of biological and social factors in language acquisition rather than a specific innate mechanism. The \"Imitation and reinforcement system\" is also wrong, as this concept is part of learning theory, which suggests language development occurs through imitation and reinforcement, not an innate biological process. Lastly, \"Cognitive schema processor\" is incorrect because it does not specifically relate to language acquisition; rather, cognitive schemas pertain to general cognitive development and understanding rather than the innate capacity for language as proposed by Chomsky.",

      "answer": "Morphology",
      "explanation": "1. \"Morphology\" is the correct answer because it specifically addresses the rules governing the use of morphemes, which are the smallest units of language that carry meaning. Morphology encompasses both free morphemes, which can stand alone as words, and bound morphemes, which must be combined with other morphemes to convey meaning. This component of language is essential for understanding how words are formed and modified in a language.\n\n2. \n- **Phonology** is incorrect because it refers to the rules for using phonemes, the smallest units of sound in a language, rather than the rules for combining morphemes.\n- **Syntax** is incorrect because it involves the rules that determine how words can be combined into sentences, focusing on the structure of phrases and sentences rather than the combination of morphemes.\n- **Pragmatics** is incorrect because it pertains to the use and meaning of language in social contexts, including conversational rules and nonverbal cues, rather than the formation and combination of morphemes.",

      "answer": "Social interactionist theory",
      "explanation": "1. **Social interactionist theory** is the correct answer because it posits that language acquisition depends on a combination of biological and social factors, emphasizing the importance of interaction between children and caregivers. This theory highlights how caregivers' use of child-directed speech—characterized by a slower pace, higher pitch, and simpler vocabulary—facilitates children's understanding and use of language in a supportive environment.\n\n2. **Learning theory** is incorrect because it focuses on language development as a result of imitation and reinforcement, rather than emphasizing the interactional role of caregivers. **Nativist theory** is also incorrect because it argues that humans are biologically programmed to acquire language through an inborn linguistic processor (the LAD), without emphasizing the influence of social factors like caregiver speech. Lastly, **cognitive-developmental theory** is incorrect as it centers on cognitive processes involved in language acquisition rather than the social interactions and environmental factors that aid in learning language, such as child-directed speech.",

      "answer": "18 to 24 months",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"18 to 24 months,\" is based on the language development milestones outlined in the reference material. During this period, children begin to use telegraphic speech, which consists of two-word phrases that convey meaning, such as \"want juice\" or \"doggie gone.\" This stage represents an important advancement in language development as children start to express more complex thoughts using minimal words.\n\n2. The option \"6 to 8 weeks\" is incorrect because, at this age, infants are in the cooing stage, producing vowel-like sounds rather than forming words or phrases. The option \"3 to 6 months\" is also wrong since infants are typically babbling during this stage, which involves consonant-vowel combinations rather than meaningful speech. Lastly, \"12 to 15 months\" is incorrect because, although children may say their first words around this age, telegraphic speech does not begin until they are 18 to 24 months old.",

      ],
      "answer": "Misapplying grammatical rules such as pluralization or past tense",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Misapplying grammatical rules such as pluralization or past tense,\" accurately describes overregularization, which occurs when children apply regular grammatical rules to irregular forms. For example, a child might say \"foots\" instead of \"feet\" or \"telled\" instead of \"told,\" demonstrating their understanding of grammatical patterns but misapplying them to exceptions.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Using a word with an overly broad meaning,\" refers to overextension, where a child uses a word too broadly, such as calling all four-legged animals \"doggie.\" The second incorrect option, \"Using language appropriate only for a narrow context,\" describes underextension, where a child uses a word too narrowly, such as using \"doggie\" to refer only to their pet. The third incorrect option, \"Repeating words without understanding their meaning,\" pertains to echolalia, which involves repeating sounds or words heard from others without comprehension, rather than misapplying grammatical rules.",

      "answer": "Early exposure to language is crucial for full proficiency in grammar and syntax",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Early exposure to language is crucial for full proficiency in grammar and syntax\" is correct because research indicates a strong negative relationship between the age of exposure to language and proficiency in grammar and syntax. Studies have shown that full proficiency in these aspects of language requires early exposure, particularly during critical periods such as the first year of life (Friedmann & Rusou, 2015).\n\n2. The incorrect option \"Exposure to language after adolescence has no effect on vocabulary acquisition\" is wrong because while late exposure may affect proficiency, it does not imply that vocabulary acquisition is entirely unaffected; individuals can still learn vocabulary at older ages. The statement \"Semantics and vocabulary are equally impaired by late language exposure\" is incorrect because research suggests that semantics and vocabulary size are less affected by age of exposure compared to grammar and syntax. Finally, the option \"Sign language and spoken language do not follow similar developmental trajectories\" is inaccurate as evidence shows that both spoken and sign language exhibit parallel developmental trajectories when exposure begins at birth (Mayberry, 2010).",

      "answer": "Code-switching",
      "explanation": "1. \"Code-switching\" is the correct answer because it specifically refers to bilingual or multilingual speakers’ practice of using more than one language or language variety within a single interaction or conversational turn. This phenomenon often occurs unconsciously, although speakers may also use it consciously for various communicative purposes, such as expressing emotions or compensating for language deficiencies.\n\n2. The term \"language brokering\" is incorrect because it describes the act of translating and interpreting within immigrant families by children and adolescents for their parents and others, rather than the use of multiple languages in conversation. \"Paralanguage\" is also incorrect as it refers to how something is said (such as tone and intonation) rather than the use of different languages in speech. Lastly, \"overextension\" is incorrect because it pertains to a language error where a child uses a word too broadly, such as calling all furry animals \"doggie,\" rather than addressing the mixing of languages in conversation.",

      ],
      "answer": "Loud high-pitched cry with silence",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"loud high-pitched cry with silence\" because this type of cry specifically signals pain in a newborn. According to the reference material, this cry is characterized by a loud, high-pitched sound followed by a period of silence, which occurs due to breath-holding, indicating a distress signal related to pain.\n\n2. The option \"low-pitched rhythmic cry\" is incorrect because this type of cry signals hunger or discomfort, not pain. The \"shrill, less regular cry\" is also wrong as it indicates anger or frustration, rather than pain. Lastly, \"monotone continuous cry\" is not mentioned in the reference material as a specific type of cry and does not correspond to any defined categories of crying behaviors in newborns.",

This process involves children and adolescents acting as intermediaries who translate and interpret between their immigrant parents and other individuals, thereby facilitating communication within the family and community.\n\n2. The option \"Parents teaching children a second language at home\" is incorrect because it refers to a different process of language learning and acquisition rather than the act of brokering language between family members. \"Using gestures and facial expressions during communication\" is also incorrect, as it focuses on non-verbal communication rather than the verbal translation and interpretation role that children play in language brokering. Lastly, \"Switching between languages during conversations\" is wrong because it describes code-switching, which involves bi- and multilingual speakers using multiple languages in a single interaction, rather than the specific act of children translating for their parents or family members.",

      ],
      "answer": "Manual babbling consisting of repetitive hand movements",
      "explanation": "1. \"Manual babbling consisting of repetitive hand movements\" is the correct answer because, similar to how hearing infants produce vocal babbling, deaf infants exposed to American Sign Language (ASL) begin to exhibit manual babbling at about 6 to 8 months of age. This manual babbling involves repetitive hand movements that replicate components of ASL, reflecting the natural progression of language development in both hearing and deaf infants.\n\n2. The option \"Echolalia involving repetition of spoken words\" is incorrect because echolalia occurs around 9 months of age and involves repeating speech sounds and words without understanding their meaning, which is not applicable to deaf infants who do not hear spoken language. \"Acoustic babbling restricted to vocal sounds\" is wrong because it pertains specifically to hearing infants, as deaf infants do not engage in vocal babbling in the same way due to their lack of auditory feedback. Lastly, \"Early sign sentences combining words and gestures\" is incorrect because this behavior develops later in language acquisition, after the initial stage of manual babbling, and involves more complex use of signs rather than the simple repetitive movements seen in manual babbling.",

      "answer": "Slow, high-pitched voice with exaggerated emphasis on key words",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Slow, high-pitched voice with exaggerated emphasis on key words,\" aligns with the characteristics of child-directed speech (parentese), which has been shown to facilitate language development in young children. This form of speech captures infants’ attention and enhances their ability to recognize and process the sounds and structures of language, thereby aiding their acquisition of language skills.\n\n2. The option \"Speaking quickly and using complex sentences\" is incorrect because rapid speech and complex sentence structures can overwhelm young children, making it harder for them to learn and understand language. \"Using a monotone voice with varied vocabulary\" is wrong as a monotone delivery lacks the emotional engagement and emphasis that are crucial for maintaining a child's interest and aiding comprehension. Lastly, \"Avoiding repetition and using adult conversational style\" is incorrect because repetition is a key feature of child-directed speech that reinforces language learning, while an adult conversational style may not be accessible or relatable for young children, hindering their language development.",

      "answer": "Combined (bimodal-bilingual) approach using both sign language and spoken language supports",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Combined (bimodal-bilingual) approach using both sign language and spoken language supports\" is the correct answer because current evidence suggests that exposure to language from birth is essential for language development in deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) children. This approach allows for the benefits of both sign language and spoken language, supporting cognitive, socioemotional, and overall development. Studies indicate that children with cochlear implants who were exposed to sign language from birth achieve language proficiency comparable to their hearing peers, highlighting the importance of a dual approach (Hall, Hall, & Caselli, 2019).\n\n2. **Exclusive reliance on cochlear implants without sign language exposure** is incorrect because it may lead to language deprivation, as cochlear implants are typically not implanted until children are 12 months or older, which delays language exposure. **Early exposure to sign language alone without spoken language intervention** is also wrong because, while it provides essential communication skills, it may not fully support the development of spoken language skills, which can be beneficial for DHH children. Lastly, **delayed language exposure to allow for auditory training before any language input** is incorrect because it contradicts the consensus that immediate exposure to language—whether signed or spoken—is crucial for optimal language development.",
