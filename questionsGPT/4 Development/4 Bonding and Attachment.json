      ],
      "answer": "Monkeys became attached to the cloth mother despite the wire mother providing food",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Monkeys became attached to the cloth mother despite the wire mother providing food,\" reflects Harlow and Zimmerman's (1959) findings that emphasized the importance of *contact comfort* in attachment. The infant monkeys preferred the soft, cloth mother for comfort and security, seeking her out even when the wire mother provided sustenance, demonstrating that emotional needs can outweigh basic physical needs in forming attachments.\n\n2. The option \"Monkeys preferred the wire mother because it provided food\" is incorrect because the study showed that the monkeys chose the cloth mother for comfort over the wire mother that provided food, indicating that attachment is driven more by emotional connection than by the availability of food. The statement \"Monkeys showed equal attachment to the wire and cloth mothers\" is also wrong, as the research clearly indicated a strong preference for the cloth mother, highlighting the significance of comfort in attachment. Lastly, the option \"Monkeys did not show significant attachment behaviors toward either surrogate mother\" is inaccurate because the monkeys exhibited clear attachment behaviors, such as clinging to the cloth mother and seeking her out when distressed, confirming the presence of attachment.",

      ],
      "answer": "To elicit caregiver attention and ensure proximity for survival",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"To elicit caregiver attention and ensure proximity for survival,\" aligns with Bowlby’s ethological theory of attachment, which posits that infants are biologically predisposed to engage in attachment behaviors such as crying and smiling. These behaviors serve to attract the caregiver's attention and ensure that the caregiver remains close, thus enhancing the infant's chances of survival by receiving care and protection during vulnerable periods.\n\n2. The option \"To entertain the infant\" is incorrect because attachment behaviors are primarily survival-oriented rather than for the infant's entertainment; they are crucial for obtaining care rather than for amusement. \"To establish dominance over caregivers\" is also wrong, as attachment behaviors are not about asserting control but rather about fostering a bond that ensures the caregiver's responsiveness and support. Lastly, \"To express the infant’s mood without caregiver response\" is misleading because attachment behaviors are specifically designed to provoke a response from caregivers, thereby ensuring the infant's needs are met rather than merely expressing feelings without expectation of interaction.",

      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Insecure-resistant (ambivalent) attachment**  \nThe \"insecure-resistant (ambivalent) attachment\" pattern is characterized by infants who stay close to their mothers initially and exhibit significant distress when separated. Upon reunion, these infants may display anger or resistance toward their mothers, indicating confusion and inconsistency in their attachment behavior. This pattern reflects the inconsistent caregiving that leads to heightened anxiety and ambivalence in the infant's attachment.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Secure attachment:** Infants with secure attachment explore their environment when their mother is present, may show some distress upon separation, but actively seek comfort and contact upon reunion, preferring their mother over a stranger.\n- **Insecure-avoidant attachment:** Infants with this pattern seem indifferent toward their mothers, showing little distress when separated and avoiding contact upon reunion, indicating a lack of emotional connection.\n- **Disorganized/disoriented attachment:** This pattern is characterized by fearful behavior toward the mother and confusion upon reunion, often seen in infants who have experienced maltreatment, rather than the clear distress and resistance typical of insecure-resistant attachment.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Insecure attachment is more common in low SES families due to associated risk factors but secure attachment can occur with good parenting,\" is supported by research indicating that children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds are more likely to be insecurely attached due to risk factors such as poor parental education, parental drug use, and father absence. However, it is also noted that secure attachment can still develop in low SES families when parenting quality is high, demonstrating that good parenting practices can mitigate the negative impacts of low SES.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Low SES directly causes insecure attachment regardless of parenting quality,\" is wrong because it oversimplifies the relationship by ignoring the role of parenting quality, which can lead to secure attachment even in low SES contexts. The second incorrect option, \"Secure attachment only occurs in high SES families,\" is incorrect as it fails to recognize that secure attachment can be achieved in families across various SES levels, particularly when parenting is responsive and sensitive. Lastly, the option \"Attachment patterns are not influenced by SES or related factors\" is inaccurate because research clearly indicates that SES and associated risk factors significantly impact attachment security, emphasizing that these factors play a crucial role in the development of attachment patterns.",

      ],
      "answer": "5 to 7 months",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"5 to 7 months,\" is supported by research indicating that infants do not reliably discriminate between facial expressions until this age. During this period, they begin to categorize emotions, recognizing similarities in facial expressions and showing a shift in preference toward fearful expressions, which is attributed to their increasing exposure to various emotional expressions (Xie et al., 2019).\n\n2. The option \"Immediately after birth\" is incorrect because research shows that infants are not capable of recognizing or categorizing facial expressions right after birth; they require time to develop this ability. \"2 to 3 months\" is also incorrect, as studies indicate that while infants may show some basic responses to emotions, they do not reliably categorize facial expressions until around 5 to 7 months. Lastly, \"12 to 18 months\" is incorrect because by this age, infants have already developed the ability to recognize and categorize facial expressions, and the shift in preference toward fearful expressions occurs earlier, around 7 months.",

      "answer": "Clarification of goals",
      "explanation": "1. \"Clarification of goals\" is the correct answer because, according to Crick and Dodge’s social information processing model, this step involves the identification of the goals that aggressive children set in response to provocation. In ambiguous situations, aggressive children often prioritize retaliation as their goal, interpreting the provocation as a threat that necessitates a defensive or aggressive response to restore their perceived status or resolve the conflict.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- **Encoding of cues**: This step refers to how aggressive children focus on specific aspects of a provocation, often those that suggest hostility, rather than the entirety of the situation, which does not directly address their goal-setting process.\n  \n- **Interpretation of cues**: This step involves how aggressive children interpret the intentions behind the provocation, often assuming hostile intent, but it does not explain the subsequent decision-making regarding their goals for response.\n\n- **Response search**: This step pertains to the options that aggressive children consider for responding to provocation; while they may identify aggressive responses, it does not specifically explain why retaliation is chosen as a primary goal in the first place.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Guilt focuses on a specific behavior, shame focuses on the self,\" accurately reflects the definitions provided in the reference material. Guilt is described as occurring when individuals feel bad about something they have done, indicating a focus on their actions. In contrast, shame is characterized by feelings of inadequacy or negative evaluation of oneself, emphasizing a broader self-focus rather than specific behaviors.\n\n2. The option \"Shame focuses on a specific behavior, guilt focuses on the self\" is incorrect because it reverses the definitions; shame is concerned with the self, while guilt pertains to specific actions. The statement \"Shame and guilt both focus equally on the self and behavior\" is incorrect as it fails to recognize the distinct nature of each emotion, with shame being more self-centered and guilt being behavior-centered. Lastly, \"Guilt is unrelated to self-blame, shame is related\" is incorrect because guilt inherently involves self-blame regarding one’s actions, while shame is about self-evaluation and feeling bad about oneself.",

      "answer": "Seeking emotional closeness and positive feelings",
      "explanation": "1. \"Seeking emotional closeness and positive feelings\" is the correct answer because, according to Carstensen's socioemotional selectivity theory, older adults who perceive their time as limited prioritize emotional connections over knowledge-seeking. This shift occurs as they focus on relationships that evoke positive emotions and provide emotional support, reflecting a preference for meaningful interactions rather than future-oriented goals.\n\n2. The option \"Gathering new information for future use\" is incorrect because this motivation is characteristic of individuals who view their time as unlimited and are more focused on acquiring knowledge rather than emotional closeness. \"Expanding social networks\" is also wrong, as older adults tend to be more selective about their friendships and prioritize quality over quantity, seeking deeper connections instead of broader social circles. Lastly, \"Establishing professional connections\" is not aligned with the motivations of older adults, who generally shift away from professional networking in favor of nurturing emotionally fulfilling relationships as they approach the later stages of life.",

Research indicates that these adults typically have children who develop secure attachment patterns, as their ability to reflect positively and coherently on their own attachment experiences fosters a nurturing environment for their offspring.\n\n2. The option \"Preoccupied\" is incorrect because adults in this category exhibit angry or confused feelings toward their childhood relationships, which often leads to their children developing a resistant attachment pattern. \"Dismissing\" is also incorrect; these adults provide positive descriptions of their childhood yet lack coherence, resulting in their children often developing an avoidant attachment pattern. Lastly, \"Unresolved\" is not listed in the reference material, but it generally refers to adults who have unresolved trauma or loss, which can lead to disorganized attachment patterns in their children.",

      "answer": "Both parents and children learn that aggressive behaviors can stop undesirable behaviors in the other",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Both parents and children learn that aggressive behaviors can stop undesirable behaviors in the other,\" aligns with Patterson et al.'s coercive family interaction model. This model posits that parents may resort to threats and physical punishment to manage their children's misbehavior, while children learn that they can use aggressive behaviors to influence their parents' actions, thereby creating a cycle of escalating aggression within the family dynamics.\n\n2. The option \"Parents use consistent and positive discipline strategies to reduce aggression\" is incorrect because the coercive family interaction model emphasizes inconsistent and coercive methods rather than positive discipline. \"Children learn to avoid aggression because it results in punishment\" is wrong as the model suggests that children actually learn to use aggression as a means to achieve their goals, rather than avoiding it due to punishment. Lastly, the statement \"Aggression in children is solely due to genetic predispositions\" is incorrect because the coercive family interaction model highlights the role of learned behaviors and family dynamics, not just genetic factors, in the development of aggression.",

Effective parenting characterized by sensitivity and responsiveness to a child's needs fosters secure attachment, which is crucial for the child's emotional and social development, regardless of external socioeconomic factors.\n\n2. The option \"High parental education is the only factor needed for secure attachment\" is incorrect because while parental education can contribute to parenting quality, it is not the sole determinant of secure attachment; responsive caregiving is essential regardless of educational background. The statement \"Absence of all socioeconomic stressors\" is incorrect because secure attachment can still develop in the presence of some stressors if parenting remains supportive and sensitive.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Attachment is influenced by the emotional and physical comfort provided by caregivers,\" is supported by Harlow and Zimmerman's (1959) research with infant monkeys, which demonstrated that the preference for a cloth mother over a wire mother, despite the latter providing food, highlights the significance of contact comfort in forming attachment. This aligns with Bowlby’s (1969) ethological theory, which posits that infants are biologically predisposed to seek proximity to caregivers for emotional security, indicating that emotional and physical comfort are crucial for developing attachment.\n\n2. The option \"Attachment is primarily based on the provision of food\" is incorrect because Harlow and Zimmerman's study clearly showed that comfort and emotional connection were more important than food in forming attachment. The statement \"Attachment is solely determined by the amount of time spent with a caregiver\" is misleading, as attachment is influenced by the quality of interactions rather than just the quantity of time spent together.

      ],
      "answer": "Consistent emotional support fosters attachment similar to the comfort provided by the cloth mother.",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Consistent emotional support fosters attachment similar to the comfort provided by the cloth mother\" is correct because Harlow and Zimmerman's research demonstrated that infant monkeys preferred the comfort of the cloth mother over the wire mother that provided food, highlighting the importance of emotional and physical comfort in forming attachments. This aligns with the finding that children who receive consistent emotional support from their parents are more likely to develop secure attachments, as emotional support is a key component in fostering a strong, affectionate bond with caregivers.\n\n2. The option \"Secure attachments arise only when parents provide food\" is incorrect because Harlow's study emphasized that contact comfort, not just food, is crucial for attachment formation. The statement \"The emotional support from parents is less important than physical presence\" is wrong as it overlooks the significance of emotional support, which is vital for developing secure attachment, as evidenced by Harlow's findings. Lastly, the claim \"Attachment styles are unrelated to early childhood experiences\" is incorrect because extensive research, including Bowlby's ethological theory, establishes that early attachment experiences significantly influence attachment styles throughout life.",
