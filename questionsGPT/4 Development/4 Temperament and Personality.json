      ],
      "answer": "Mildly negative mood, low activity, slow adaptation",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"mildly negative mood, low activity, slow adaptation,\" accurately describes a 'slow-to-warm-up' child according to Thomas and Chess's temperament categories. These children exhibit a mildly negative mood and take time to adapt to new people and situations, which aligns with the characteristics outlined in the reference material. Additionally, they tend to have low levels of activity and moderately regular feeding and sleeping routines, further supporting this classification.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"positive mood, adapts easily, regular routines,\" describes an 'easy child,' who is characterized by a positive mood and adaptability, which contradicts the traits of a slow-to-warm-up child. The second incorrect option, \"negative mood, cries frequently, irregular routines,\" aligns with the characteristics of a 'difficult child,' who exhibits a negative mood and high activity levels, thus not fitting the slow-to-warm-up profile. Lastly, the third incorrect option, \"very active, responds negatively to new situations,\" describes a 'difficult child' as well, who is characterized by high activity and intense negative reactions, which does not represent the low activity level of a slow-to-warm-up child.",

      ],
      "answer": "Constitutional differences in reactivity and self-regulation",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Constitutional differences in reactivity and self-regulation,\" aligns with Rothbart's definition of temperament, which emphasizes the inherent biological makeup of individuals that influences their reactivity to stimuli and their ability to self-regulate those reactions. Rothbart describes temperament as involving two key components: reactivity, which encompasses the intensity and duration of responses to stimuli, and self-regulation, which refers to the processes that help manage those responses effectively.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Behavioral style categorized into three types,\" is wrong because it refers to Thomas and Chess's classification of temperament, which categorizes children into easy, difficult, and slow-to-warm-up types, rather than Rothbart's focus on reactivity and self-regulation. The second incorrect option, \"Tendency to withdraw from unfamiliar situations,\" is incorrect as it specifically describes Kagan's concept of behavioral inhibition, not Rothbart's broader definition of temperament. Lastly, the option \"Biological maturation without environmental influence\" is incorrect because Rothbart acknowledges that temperament is influenced by both heredity and environmental experiences, contrary to the suggestion that it is solely determined by biological maturation.",

      "answer": "Will",
      "explanation": "1. \"Will\" is the correct answer because, according to Erikson’s psychosocial stages of development, the conflict of 'autonomy vs. shame and doubt' occurs during the ages of 1 to 3 years. Successfully resolving this conflict leads to the virtue of will, which reflects a child's developing sense of independence and the ability to make choices confidently.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n   - **Hope:** This virtue is associated with the successful resolution of the 'trust vs. mistrust' stage, which occurs from birth to 1 year, focusing on the infant's reliance on caregivers.\n   - **Purpose:** This virtue arises from the resolution of the 'initiative vs. guilt' stage, which occurs between ages 3 and 6, emphasizing a child's ability to take initiative and assert control over their environment.\n   - **Competence:** This virtue is linked to the 'industry vs. inferiority' stage, which spans ages 6 to 12, where children develop a sense of competence through mastering skills and tasks.",

Authoritarian parents enforce strict rules and emphasize parental control, often using harsh punishment, which leads to children exhibiting insecurity, moodiness, and poorer social skills compared to children raised in more supportive environments.\n\n2. The incorrect options are:\n\n- **Authoritative:** This style is characterized by high demandingness and high responsiveness, leading to children who are self-confident, independent, and cooperative, which contrasts with the negative outcomes associated with authoritarian parenting.\n  \n- **Permissive:** Permissive parents are low in demandingness and high in responsiveness, resulting in children who tend to be self-centered and have poor impulse control, rather than the insecurity and moodiness seen in children of authoritarian parents.\n  \n- **Uninvolved:** Uninvolved parents are low in both demandingness and responsiveness, which typically leads to the worst outcomes, including low self-esteem and poor social skills, but does not specifically align with the characteristics of insecurity and moodiness associated with authoritarian parenting.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Neuroticism decreases; agreeableness and conscientiousness increase; extraversion remains stable or decreases slightly,\" accurately reflects the findings from studies on personality traits during adulthood. Research indicates that neuroticism tends to decrease as individuals age, while agreeableness and conscientiousness show a tendency to increase. Additionally, extraversion remains relatively stable or may experience a slight decrease, aligning with the observed patterns of mean-level change in personality traits among adults (McCrae et al., 2000; Soto et al., 2011).\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Neuroticism and openness increase; agreeableness and conscientiousness decrease,\" is wrong because it contradicts the established finding that neuroticism decreases and that agreeableness and conscientiousness increase during adulthood. The second incorrect option, \"All five traits remain highly stable with no significant mean-level changes,\" is incorrect as it overlooks the predictable mean-level changes observed in specific traits like neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.

      ],
      "answer": "18 to 24 months",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"18 to 24 months,\" is based on the mirror self-recognition test, which assesses self-awareness in children. Research indicates that by this age range, most children can recognize themselves in a mirror, as evidenced by touching the red spot placed on their own nose or cheek, rather than the reflection, demonstrating their understanding of being a distinct individual.\n\n2. The option \"6 to 12 months\" is incorrect because infants in this age range generally lack the cognitive development necessary to recognize themselves in a mirror. The option \"12 to 18 months\" is also wrong, as children typically do not pass the mirror self-recognition test until they reach 18 months or older. Lastly, \"3 to 4 years\" is incorrect because, while children may have further developed self-awareness by this age, they are expected to pass the test well before reaching three years old, specifically between 18 to 24 months.",

      "answer": "Identity moratorium",
      "explanation": "1. \"Identity moratorium\" is the correct answer because it is defined as the status where individuals have experienced or are experiencing an identity crisis but have not yet made a commitment to a specific identity. This status reflects a period of exploration and uncertainty, where individuals actively search for their identity but have not settled on a definitive path.\n\n2. \"Identity diffusion\" is incorrect because it describes individuals who have neither undergone an identity crisis nor made a commitment to an identity, indicating a lack of exploration altogether. \"Identity foreclosure\" is also incorrect as it refers to individuals who have not experienced an identity crisis but have made a strong commitment to an identity based on the values and beliefs of authority figures, rather than their own exploration. Finally, \"identity achievement\" is incorrect because this status is characterized by individuals who have successfully navigated an identity crisis and made a strong commitment to a specific identity, indicating resolution rather than ongoing exploration.",

      "answer": "Bem’s gender schema theory",
      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Bem’s gender schema theory** proposes that children organize gender-related experiences and information into gender schemas, which they use to perceive, encode, and interpret information about themselves and others. This theory emphasizes how children actively construct their understanding of gender roles based on their experiences and societal norms, influencing their behaviors and preferences.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n   - **Kohlberg’s cognitive developmental theory** focuses on the stages of gender identity development, asserting that children understand their gender identity through cognitive development, but it does not address how they organize gender-related experiences into schemas.\n   - **Social learning theory** emphasizes the role of social factors, such as observation and reinforcement, in acquiring gender-typed behaviors, but it does not specifically describe the organization of experiences into schemas.\n   - **Egan and Perry’s multidimensional model** identifies the components of gender identity, such as membership knowledge and gender typicality, but it does not propose that children organize their experiences into schemas guiding their perceptions and behaviors.",

Neuroticism is characterized by mood instability and a tendency to experience negative emotions such as sadness, fear, and irritability, which are traits that have been observed to be more pronounced in women compared to men.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- **Assertiveness:** Men tend to score higher on assertiveness, which reflects confidence and the ability to express oneself forcefully, rather than women.\n  \n- **Openness to ideas:** This trait shows relatively stable scores between genders, with no consistent evidence indicating that women score higher than men across cultures.\n\n- **Extraversion:** While extraversion can vary, studies generally show that men and women score similarly on this trait, with no consistent advantage for women in terms of overall extraversion levels.",

      "answer": "The match between a child’s temperament and social environment influences behavioral outcomes",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The match between a child’s temperament and social environment influences behavioral outcomes,\" is accurate because Thomas and Chess’s goodness-of-fit model posits that a child's behavioral and emotional outcomes are significantly affected by how well their temperament aligns with the demands of their social environment. For instance, children with difficult temperaments can adapt better and show improved outcomes when supported by a stable and accommodating environment.\n\n2. The option \"Temperament is genetically fixed and unchangeable\" is incorrect because temperament is described as being both genetically based and environmentally influenced, indicating that it can change over time with different experiences. The statement \"All children fall neatly into easy, slow-to-warm-up, or difficult categories\" is misleading because while these categories exist, not all children fit perfectly into these groups; they may exhibit a blend of characteristics. Lastly, \"Parental strictness leads to better temperamental adjustment\" is wrong because strictness alone does not guarantee better outcomes; rather, the model emphasizes the importance of the fit between temperament and the parenting style, which can vary widely.",

      "answer": "Uninvolved (Neglectful)",
      "explanation": "1. \"Uninvolved (Neglectful)\" is the correct answer because Tapia et al. (2018) found that this parenting style is most strongly associated with juvenile delinquency. Uninvolved parents are characterized by low demandingness and low responsiveness, leading to children who have poor self-esteem, low self-control, and are prone to moodiness and irritability. These negative outcomes increase the likelihood of engaging in delinquent behaviors.\n\n2. \n- **Permissive:** This parenting style is low in demandingness and high in responsiveness, which results in children who are self-centered and rebellious but does not have the strongest association with juvenile delinquency compared to uninvolved parenting.\n- **Authoritative:** Authoritative parents are high in both demandingness and responsiveness, leading to positive outcomes in children, such as high self-esteem and good social skills, which are not linked to delinquency.\n- **Authoritarian:** While authoritarian parents exert high control and low warmth, which can lead to negative outcomes, the research indicates that uninvolved parenting has a stronger link to juvenile delinquency than authoritarian parenting.",

      "answer": "The ability to inhibit a dominant response to perform a subdominant one",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The ability to inhibit a dominant response to perform a subdominant one,\" accurately describes 'effortful control' in Rothbart’s temperament model. Effortful control is a component of self-regulation, which refers to processes that facilitate, maintain, and inhibit reactivity. It specifically involves the capacity to manage one’s responses effectively, allowing an individual to suppress an automatic or dominant reaction in favor of a more appropriate or less impulsive response.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"The biological reactivity to stimuli,\" is wrong because it describes reactivity, which refers to the intensity and duration of responses to stimuli, rather than the self-regulatory aspect of effortful control. The second incorrect option, \"The tendency to respond negatively and withdraw from new situations,\" misrepresents effortful control by conflating it with behavioral inhibition, which is characterized by negative affect and withdrawal, rather than self-regulation. Lastly, \"The overall activity level and pleasure-seeking behavior\" is incorrect because it pertains to the surgency/extraversion factor of temperament, focusing on activity levels and pleasure-seeking, rather than the ability to control or inhibit responses.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"High typicality and high contentedness relate to positive self-esteem and social outcomes,\" aligns with Egan and Perry’s multidimensional model of gender identity, which indicates that individuals who perceive their characteristics as similar to those of their gender (high typicality) and are satisfied with their gender (high contentedness) experience better psychological adjustment, including higher self-esteem and greater peer acceptance. Research has shown that these positive outcomes are linked to an individual’s overall adjustment and social functioning.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Low typicality and low contentedness are linked to high self-esteem and peer acceptance,\" is wrong because low typicality and contentedness are generally associated with negative self-esteem and social outcomes, not positive ones. The second option, \"High felt pressure corresponds to high self-esteem and well-being,\" is incorrect as high felt pressure is linked to adjustment problems rather than positive self-esteem and well-being.

      "answer": "Self-centeredness and poor impulse control",
      "explanation": "1. \"Self-centeredness and poor impulse control\" is the correct answer because children raised by permissive parents, who are low in demandingness and high in responsiveness, often lack the necessary boundaries and structure to develop self-regulation. These children are encouraged to express their feelings without guidance, leading to behaviors characterized by self-centeredness and a lack of impulse control, resulting in challenges in social skills and academic achievement.\n\n2. The option \"High self-confidence and cooperation\" is incorrect because children of authoritative parents, who provide structure and warmth, typically exhibit these traits, whereas permissive parenting often leads to the opposite outcomes. \"Insecurity and dependency\" is wrong as these traits are more associated with children of authoritarian parents, who emphasize control and lack warmth, rather than permissive parents.

The correct answer, \"Shows reluctance in new situations,\" accurately reflects the characteristics of a child categorized as 'slow-to-warm-up' according to Thomas and Chess's temperament model. Slow-to-warm-up children typically exhibit a mildly negative mood and take time to adapt to new people and situations, which leads them to show reluctance or hesitation when facing unfamiliar environments or individuals.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Easily engages with new peers,\" is wrong because slow-to-warm-up children are characterized by their cautiousness and difficulty in adapting to new social interactions, rather than ease in engaging with others.

Lastly, \"Frequently smiles and laughs\" is incorrect because slow-to-warm-up children tend to have a more reserved demeanor, which does not align with the frequent expression of joy characterized by easier temperamental types.",

      ],
      "answer": "Gradually approaches new toys after observation",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Gradually approaches new toys after observation,\" aligns with the characteristics of a 'slow-to-warm-up' child as described by Thomas and Chess. These children typically exhibit a mildly negative mood and take time to adapt to new people and situations, indicating they prefer to observe before engaging. Their low levels of activity and moderate regularity in routines further support a cautious approach to unfamiliar stimuli, such as new toys.\n\n2. The option \"Eagerly explores unfamiliar environments\" is incorrect because it describes behavior typical of 'easy children,' who adapt quickly and show a positive mood towards new experiences. \"Quickly adapts to changes in routine\" is also incorrect, as 'slow-to-warm-up' children are characterized by their hesitance and gradual adaptation rather than quick adjustments. Finally, \"Displays intense reactions to new experiences\" is incorrect because this behavior is indicative of 'difficult children,' who exhibit negative moods and strong reactions to new stimuli, contrasting with the more subdued responses of 'slow-to-warm-up' children.",
