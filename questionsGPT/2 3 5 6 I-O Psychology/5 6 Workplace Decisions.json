      ],
      "answer": "A routine decision governed by established rules and policies",
      "explanation": "1. \"A routine decision governed by established rules and policies\" is the correct answer because programmed decisions are characterized as repetitive and routine, made according to established guidelines. These decisions are typically made by lower-level personnel and involve predictable scenarios, such as hiring or billing, which align with the definition provided in the reference material.\n\n2. The option \"A novel and complex decision requiring creative problem-solving\" is incorrect because this describes nonprogrammed decisions, which are unique and require judgment and creativity, contrasting with the routine nature of programmed decisions. The option \"A decision focused on developing new products and services\" is wrong because such decisions are typically nonprogrammed, involving complexity and the need for innovative solutions rather than established rules. Lastly, \"A high-level decision involving legal issue response\" is incorrect as it also pertains to nonprogrammed decisions, which are usually made by upper-level personnel and require unique problem-solving rather than following routine procedures.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"They satisfice by selecting the first minimally acceptable alternative,\" aligns with Simon's bounded rationality model, which posits that individuals face limitations such as time constraints and cognitive abilities when making decisions. As a result, rather than seeking the optimal solution, individuals often stop searching for alternatives once they find one that meets their minimum criteria, a process known as \"satisficing.\"\n\n2. The incorrect option \"They identify and evaluate all possible alternatives to find the optimal choice\" is wrong because this describes the rational model of decision-making, which assumes that decision-makers have the capacity to evaluate every possible alternative thoroughly, contrary to the limitations highlighted in the bounded rationality model. \n\nThe option \"They rely on organizational routines and standard operating procedures\" is incorrect because this describes the organizational process model, which focuses on how decisions are constrained by existing routines rather than the cognitive limitations of individual decision-makers emphasized by bounded rationality.\n\nLastly, \"They make incremental choices responding to short-term conditions\" is incorrect because this statement pertains to the organizational process model, which emphasizes the influence of organizational routines and incremental decision-making rather than the individual cognitive constraints that define Simon's bounded rationality model.",

The correct answer, \"Decision-makers objectively evaluate all alternatives to choose the optimal solution,\" aligns with the key assumption of the rational (classical) model of organizational decision-making. This model posits that decision-makers engage in a systematic and thorough evaluation of all possible alternatives, aiming to select the best option based on objective criteria. Such an approach emphasizes a deliberate and orderly decision-making process, which is foundational to the rational model.\n\n2. The option \"Decisions are made by multiple groups limited by organizational routines\" is incorrect because it describes the organizational process model, which focuses on decisions made by various individuals or groups constrained by established routines rather than the individual, objective evaluation emphasized in the rational model. \n\nThe statement \"Decision-makers select outcomes based on intuition and judgment alone\" is also wrong, as it contradicts the rational model's emphasis on objective evaluation and systematic analysis rather than relying solely on intuition or personal judgment. \n\nLastly, \"Decision-making is limited by time and incomplete information\" is inaccurate in the context of the rational model, as this limitation aligns more closely with the bounded rationality model, which acknowledges that real-world decision-making is often constrained by factors like time and information availability, leading to a \"satisficing\" approach rather than an optimal one.",

      "explanation": "1. \"A directive leader and strong group cohesiveness\" is the correct answer because these factors create an environment where the desire for unanimity can overshadow critical evaluation of alternatives. According to Janis (1982), a cohesive group with a strong directive leader is more susceptible to groupthink, as members may prioritize harmony over realistic appraisals of the situation, leading to poor decision-making.\n\n2. The presence of diverse external opinions is incorrect because exposure to differing viewpoints can actually help mitigate groupthink by encouraging critical evaluation and reducing the risk of conformity. Members encouraged to express contradictory views is also incorrect; promoting dissenting opinions is a strategy to counteract groupthink, fostering a more thorough examination of alternatives.

      "answer": "Frequent devil’s advocate roles in discussions",
      "explanation": "1. \"Frequent devil’s advocate roles in discussions\" is the correct answer because it is a method proposed by Janis to combat groupthink, rather than a symptom of it. The role of a devil’s advocate encourages critical evaluation of ideas and promotes the consideration of alternative viewpoints, which directly counters the consensus-seeking behavior characteristic of groupthink.\n\n2. \n- **Illusions of invulnerability**: This symptom refers to the group's belief that they are invulnerable and cannot fail, leading to overconfidence and risky decision-making, which is a hallmark of groupthink.\n- **Self-censorship of dissenting opinions**: This occurs when group members suppress their own doubts or disagreements to maintain harmony, a key symptom of groupthink that stifles open discussion.\n- **Presence of self-appointed mindguards**: This symptom involves individuals shielding the group from dissenting information or viewpoints, reinforcing the cohesiveness of the group and inhibiting critical analysis, which is a central feature of groupthink.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Make more extreme (risky or cautious) decisions than individual members,\" accurately reflects the concept of group polarization. This phenomenon occurs when group discussions lead to decisions that are more extreme than those individuals would make alone, either leaning towards riskier or more cautious choices. The research indicates that this shift happens due to social comparison and exposure to persuasive arguments during discussions.\n\n2. The option \"Make more moderate decisions than individuals would alone\" is incorrect because group polarization specifically involves making more extreme decisions, not moderate ones. The statement \"Become less cohesive after extended group discussion\" is wrong, as group discussions often enhance cohesiveness rather than diminish it. Lastly, \"Prioritize minority opinions over majority views\" is incorrect because group polarization typically leads to the majority viewpoint becoming more pronounced, rather than elevating minority opinions.",

      "explanation": "1. \"The task is complex and members have complementary skills\" is the correct answer because research indicates that groups tend to outperform individuals when faced with complex tasks, particularly when group members possess diverse skills that complement each other. This diversity allows for a more thorough exploration of alternatives and solutions, leveraging different perspectives and expertise to address the intricacies of the task at hand.\n\n2. The option \"The task is poorly structured and requires creativity\" is incorrect because individuals generally outperform groups in poorly structured tasks that demand high creativity, as the flexibility and unique insights of individuals can lead to more innovative solutions than a group consensus might produce. \"Decisions need to be made rapidly with little information\" is wrong because rapid decision-making often favors individual decision-makers who can act quickly without the need for group deliberation, which can slow down the process. Lastly, \"All group members have similar skill sets\" is incorrect because homogeneity in skills can limit the range of perspectives and solutions available, reducing the group's effectiveness in tackling complex tasks compared to a group with diverse, complementary skills.",

The correct answer, \"Many people or groups constrained by routines and incremental choices,\" aligns with the organizational process model, which posits that decisions within organizations are typically made by multiple individuals or groups rather than a single decision-maker. This model emphasizes that decisions are influenced by established routines and standard operating procedures, leading to small incremental choices that respond to immediate conditions rather than seeking an optimal solution.\n\n2. The option \"A single, high-level decision maker seeking an optimal solution\" is incorrect because it suggests a rational model approach, where one individual evaluates all alternatives to find the best choice, which is not representative of the collaborative and routine-bound nature described in the organizational process model. The statement \"Individuals making isolated choices without procedural constraints\" is wrong as it overlooks the influence of organizational routines and the collective nature of decision-making emphasized in the organizational process model.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Appoint a member to play devil’s advocate,\" is recommended for leaders to reduce the risk of groupthink because it encourages critical evaluation of ideas and alternative courses of action. By designating someone to challenge prevailing opinions, the group is prompted to consider diverse perspectives and avoid the pitfalls of unanimous decision-making, which can lead to poor judgments due to the desire for cohesiveness.\n\n2. The option \"Encourage consensus early to speed up decision-making\" is incorrect because promoting early consensus can stifle open discussion and discourage dissenting viewpoints, increasing the risk of groupthink rather than mitigating it. \"Isolate the group from outside opinions\" is wrong as isolation can exacerbate groupthink by limiting exposure to alternative perspectives and critical feedback, which are essential for realistic appraisals of decisions. Lastly, \"Exclude members with dissenting views\" is incorrect because excluding dissenters removes valuable insights and critical perspectives that could help the group evaluate its decisions more thoroughly, thus increasing the likelihood of groupthink.",

The first incorrect option, \"Repetitive decisions governed by clear policies,\" is wrong because it describes programmed decisions, which are routine and follow established rules and procedures. The second incorrect option, \"Routine decisions made by lower-level personnel,\" is also incorrect as it pertains to programmed decisions typically made at lower organizational levels rather than the complex decisions made by upper-level personnel.

Instead, they settle for the first option that meets their minimal acceptable criteria, rather than exhaustively analyzing all possible alternatives.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- \"Choosing the best possible option after exhaustive analysis\" is incorrect because satisficing involves not optimizing or thoroughly analyzing all alternatives, but rather selecting the first acceptable one.\n- \"Deferring decisions to higher management when uncertain\" is wrong because satisficing is about making a decision within one's own capacity rather than passing the responsibility to others.\n- \"Using intuition instead of systematic evaluation\" is misleading since satisficing does not necessarily imply relying on intuition; rather, it involves a systematic but limited evaluation until a satisfactory option is found.",

      "explanation": "### Explanation of the Correct Answer\n\n\"Limiting the group’s exposure to outside experts\" is the correct answer because it increases the risk of groupthink rather than reducing it. Janis (1982) indicated that groupthink is more likely to occur when groups are isolated from outside opinions, as this can lead to a lack of diverse perspectives and critical evaluation of alternatives. Exposure to outside experts can provide new insights and challenge the group’s assumptions, thereby helping to mitigate groupthink.\n\n### Explanation of Incorrect Options\n\n- **A leader who remains neutral during discussions:** This condition helps reduce groupthink by preventing the leader's biases from influencing the group’s decision-making process, allowing for a more open exchange of ideas and opinions.\n\n- **Encouraging open expression of dissenting opinions:** Promoting an environment where dissent is welcomed can counteract groupthink by ensuring that alternative viewpoints are considered, fostering critical discussion and evaluation of options.\n\n- **Appointing a devil’s advocate:** This strategy is effective in reducing groupthink as it deliberately introduces opposing viewpoints, encouraging the group to critically assess their decisions and consider potential flaws in their thinking. \n\nBy implementing these strategies, groups can enhance their decision-making processes and minimize the likelihood of falling into the traps of groupthink.",
