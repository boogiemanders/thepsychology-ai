      ],
      "answer": "Identifying and reducing forces maintaining the current status quo",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Identifying and reducing forces maintaining the current status quo,\" is accurate because the 'unfreezing' stage in Lewin's three-step model focuses on recognizing and diminishing the factors that uphold an undesirable status quo. This stage is essential for creating a readiness for change by increasing awareness of the need for transformation within the organization.\n\n2. The option \"Implementing desired changes to establish a new equilibrium\" is incorrect because this action occurs during the 'changing' stage, not 'unfreezing.' The option \"Stabilizing the organization to prevent regression to previous states\" is wrong because this is part of the 'refreezing' stage, where the focus is on integrating and solidifying the changes made. Lastly, \"Evaluating the outcomes of organizational change interventions\" is incorrect as this evaluation occurs later in the process, specifically in the 'evaluating and institutionalizing' phase, after the changes have been implemented.",

      "answer": "Entering and contracting phase",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Entering and contracting phase\" is the correct answer because it specifically involves the OD consultant collaborating with organization members to identify primary problems, establish a relationship, and reach an agreement on expectations regarding desired outcomes. This phase is focused on developing a contractual arrangement that outlines how the consultant and organization members will work together to address the identified issues.\n\n2. The \"Diagnosing phase\" is incorrect because it centers on collecting and analyzing diagnostic information about the organization's problems rather than establishing agreements or contracts. The \"Planning and implementing phase\" is also wrong, as it focuses on creating a vision for the future, designing interventions, and managing the change process rather than the initial contracting and agreement aspects. Lastly, the \"Evaluating and institutionalizing phase\" is incorrect because it deals with assessing the implementation and results of interventions, as well as making decisions about the continuation or modification of changes, rather than the initial agreement and contracting process.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Helping the organization self-diagnose and resolve problems,\" accurately describes the role of a process consultant according to Schein (1969). A process consultant focuses on enhancing the organization's ability to identify and address its own issues, fostering self-reliance rather than providing direct solutions. This approach empowers the organization to learn and develop its problem-solving capabilities.\n\n2. The option \"Providing explicit solutions to organizational problems\" is incorrect because process consultants do not give direct answers; instead, they facilitate the organization’s learning process. \"Diagnosing and solving problems independently of the organization\" is wrong, as it contradicts the process consultant's role of engaging the organization in its own problem-solving rather than acting independently.

      "answer": "They have responsibility and control over work decisions without a supervisor",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"They have responsibility and control over work decisions without a supervisor,\" accurately describes self-managed work teams (SMWTs). SMWTs are unique in that they operate independently, with team members collectively managing all aspects of their work, including budgeting, task assignments, and performance appraisal, without the oversight of a traditional supervisor. This autonomy empowers team members to collaborate effectively and adapt their leadership roles based on expertise relevant to specific tasks.\n\n2. The option \"They are supervised by a designated team leader at all times\" is incorrect because SMWTs do not have a supervisor; instead, they function without a designated leader, allowing leadership roles to shift among team members as needed. The statement \"They primarily focus on feedback collection through surveys\" is wrong because while feedback collection is a method used in organizational development, it does not define the operational structure or focus of SMWTs, which is centered on self-management.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Strong positive effects on both job satisfaction and productivity, with unclear effects on absenteeism,\" aligns with research findings on the compressed workweek. Specifically, studies indicate that the compressed workweek leads to significant increases in job satisfaction and a positive, albeit weaker, impact on productivity; however, the effects on absenteeism remain ambiguous, as noted in the reference material.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"A strong positive effect on absenteeism and no effect on job satisfaction,\" is wrong because research indicates that the compressed workweek has a strong positive effect on job satisfaction, not absenteeism. The second incorrect option, \"No effect on job satisfaction but reduced absenteeism and productivity,\" is incorrect because it contradicts the evidence showing positive effects on job satisfaction and only a weak effect on productivity. Lastly, the third incorrect option, \"A strong negative effect on job satisfaction and increased absenteeism,\" is incorrect as it directly opposes the research findings that highlight strong positive effects on job satisfaction rather than negative ones.",

These groups discuss methods for resolving the identified problems and then provide management with recommendations, effectively engaging employees in the quality improvement process.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n   - **Benchmarking** involves measuring products, services, and practices against major competitors or industry leaders to identify ways for improving organizational processes and productivity, rather than focusing on employee-led problem identification.\n   - **Six sigma** is an approach to quality management that emphasizes training employees in statistical analysis and problem-solving methods to reduce defect rates, rather than involving employees in volunteer groups to suggest solutions.\n   - **Appreciative inquiry** combines elements of social constructionism and positive psychology to identify and build on the best aspects of an organization, focusing on envisioning positive changes rather than specifically identifying quality problems through employee groups.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"To provide a roadmap connecting program resources and activities to intended outcomes,\" accurately reflects the primary purpose of a program logic model. According to the reference material, a program logic model serves as a tool that outlines the sequence of events linking necessary resources and activities to the desired results of a program. This roadmap helps stakeholders understand how inputs and activities lead to outputs and ultimately to the expected outcomes, ensuring clarity in program planning and implementation.\n\n2. The option \"To identify ethical issues that may arise during program implementation\" is incorrect because the program logic model focuses on the connection between resources, activities, and outcomes rather than ethical considerations. The option \"To evaluate the quality of products and services compared to competitors\" is wrong as it pertains to benchmarking and quality management rather than the specific function of a program logic model in planning. Lastly, \"To prescribe exact operational steps for direct supervisor involvement\" is incorrect because the program logic model provides a broader overview of program components rather than detailed operational instructions for supervisors.",

The 4D cycle consists of the phases: Discovery (appreciating “what is”), Dream (envisioning “what could be”), Design (determining “what should be”), and Delivery/Destiny (sustaining “what will be”). Diagnosis, while important in other organizational change models, is not a phase in this specific approach.\n\n2. \n- **Design** is incorrect because it is one of the phases in the 4D cycle, where participants determine “what should be” in the organization.\n- **Delivery/Destiny** is incorrect as it is also a part of the 4D cycle, focusing on sustaining “what will be” after the changes are implemented.\n- **Discovery** is incorrect because it represents the initial phase of the 4D cycle, where the organization identifies and appreciates “what is” currently present within it.",

The correct answer, \"Provide employees with more responsibility and opportunities for advancement,\" accurately reflects the essence of job enrichment as described by Herzberg (1966). Job enrichment involves designing jobs that enhance the motivational factors related to job content, such as responsibility and opportunities for growth, which ultimately lead to increased worker satisfaction and motivation.\n\n2. The option \"Increase the number of tasks performed by employees to reduce boredom\" is incorrect because it describes job enlargement rather than job enrichment; job enrichment focuses on enhancing the quality of the job rather than merely increasing the quantity of tasks. The option \"Shorten work hours while keeping tasks unchanged\" is also incorrect, as it does not align with the principles of job enrichment, which aims to enhance job content rather than simply modify hours or maintain the same tasks. Lastly, \"Introduce flexible work timing to improve work-life balance\" is incorrect because, while flexible work arrangements can enhance employee satisfaction, they do not specifically address the core concept of job enrichment, which is about increasing responsibility and opportunities for advancement within the job itself.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Providing a structured roadmap linking resources and expected benefits,\" is supported by the program logic model as it serves to illustrate the sequence of events connecting the resources (inputs), activities, outputs, and desired outcomes of a program. The logic model effectively outlines how these components interact, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of how resources will lead to the intended benefits, thereby facilitating program planning and evaluation.\n\n2. The option \"Facilitating top management commitment to quality\" is incorrect because the program logic model focuses on the relationships between inputs and outcomes, rather than directly influencing management commitment. \"Increasing employee responsibility in self-managed teams\" is not relevant, as the logic model does not specifically address team dynamics or employee roles but rather the overall program structure. Lastly, \"Designing flexible work schedules to improve job satisfaction\" is incorrect because the logic model does not specifically pertain to designing work schedules; instead, it provides a framework for understanding how various program components contribute to outcomes, which may include job satisfaction but is not limited to that aspect.",
