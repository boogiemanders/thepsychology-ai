      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Structured interview\" because structured interviews involve asking all candidates the same questions that are derived from a job analysis and scored using a standardized scoring key. This format ensures consistency across interviews, allowing for a more objective assessment of candidates based on job-related criteria.\n\n2. The \"Unstructured interview\" is incorrect because it allows interviewers to ask any questions they choose, often leading to inconsistency and variability in the interview process. The \"Situational interview\" is also incorrect as it focuses on hypothetical scenarios rather than standardized questions derived from job analysis. Lastly, the \"Behavioral interview\" is not the correct answer because it emphasizes past behaviors in specific situations rather than using a standardized set of questions and scoring system, which is the hallmark of structured interviews.",

      "answer": "General mental ability (GMA) tests",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"General mental ability (GMA) tests\" because these tests, also known as general cognitive ability tests or intelligence tests, have been found to be the most valid predictors of job performance across a variety of jobs and organizations. Research indicates that GMA tests consistently outperform other selection techniques in terms of their predictive validity, making them a critical tool in employee selection (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004; Schmidt & Hunter, 1998).\n\n2. \n- **Personality tests assessing conscientiousness**: While conscientiousness is a strong predictor of job performance, it is not as universally valid across different jobs and organizations as GMA tests.\n- **Integrity tests**: Although integrity tests are good predictors of counterproductive behaviors and job performance, they rank lower in overall validity compared to GMA tests.\n- **Work sample tests**: Work sample tests have shown high validity in the past, but more recent analyses indicate that their validity is lower than that of GMA tests, especially when applied to a wider range of job types.",

      "answer": "They have less adverse impact on racial/ethnic minority applicants",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"They have less adverse impact on racial/ethnic minority applicants,\" highlights a significant advantage of integrity tests over general mental ability tests. Integrity tests are designed to assess an applicant's likelihood of engaging in counterproductive behaviors without showing a notable adverse impact on minority groups, making them a more equitable selection tool. In contrast, general mental ability tests are associated with a higher risk of adverse impact for applicants from ethnic/racial minority backgrounds, which raises concerns about fairness in the selection process.\n\n2. The option \"They predict cognitive performance better\" is incorrect because integrity tests do not focus on cognitive abilities; instead, they assess personality traits related to honesty and reliability, while general mental ability tests are specifically designed to measure cognitive performance. The statement \"They are easier to administer\" is misleading, as the complexity of administering either test can vary based on the context; both types of tests can require careful administration and scoring procedures. Lastly, the claim \"They are better at predicting leadership potential\" is inaccurate since integrity tests primarily predict counterproductive behaviors and job performance, whereas assessments of leadership potential typically rely on other methods, such as assessment centers or structured interviews that evaluate leadership skills directly.",

      "answer": "Multiple cutoff method",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Multiple cutoff method\" is the correct answer because it involves administering all predictors to every applicant and requires that each applicant achieve a score above a predetermined cutoff for each predictor to be considered for the job. This method ensures that all essential qualifications are met before moving forward in the selection process.\n\n2. The \"Multiple regression\" option is incorrect because it is a statistical method for combining scores from multiple predictors rather than a method for determining cutoff scores for applicants. The \"Multiple hurdles method\" is also incorrect because, unlike the multiple cutoff method, it administers predictors in a specific order, requiring applicants to meet cutoff scores sequentially rather than for all predictors at once. Lastly, the \"Compensatory method\" is incorrect because it allows for high scores on some predictors to compensate for low scores on others, which contrasts with the strict requirement of meeting cutoff scores on all predictors in the multiple cutoff method.",

      "answer": "Multiple hurdles",
      "explanation": "1. \"Multiple hurdles\" is the correct answer because it is a noncompensatory selection method that requires applicants to pass each predictor in a specified order, only proceeding to the next predictor if they meet the cutoff score on the current test. This method ensures that candidates must demonstrate a minimum level of competence on each predictor before advancing, making it effective for maintaining standards throughout the selection process.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Clinical prediction** is not a noncompensatory method; it relies on subjective judgment and does not follow a sequential cutoff approach.\n- **Multiple regression** is a compensatory method that combines scores from various predictors, allowing high scores on some predictors to offset low scores on others, rather than requiring sequential passing.\n- **Multiple cutoff** is also a noncompensatory method, but it administers all predictors to all applicants simultaneously, requiring each to meet the cutoff score without the sequential aspect of the multiple hurdles approach.",

      "answer": "Applicants may perceive them as irrelevant or invasive, leading to refusal to answer",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Applicants may perceive them as irrelevant or invasive, leading to refusal to answer,\" highlights a significant disadvantage of biodata measures. Although these measures can effectively predict job performance, some items may lack face validity, meaning they do not appear relevant to job performance from the applicant's perspective. This perceived irrelevance can lead applicants to view the questions as intrusive, causing them to refuse to provide their information.\n\n2. The option \"They typically have low predictive validity for job performance\" is incorrect because biodata has been found to be a good predictor of performance across a variety of jobs, as indicated in the reference material. The statement \"They are very costly and time-consuming to administer\" is also wrong since the reference does not mention that biodata measures are particularly costly or time-consuming; instead, they are designed to be easily scored. Lastly, the option \"They cause adverse impact against protected groups\" is inaccurate because the reference notes that integrity tests do not seem to have an adverse impact on racial/ethnic minorities, and while biodata may have similar implications, the text does not suggest that they cause adverse impact.",

This simulation is part of assessment centers, which utilize multiple methods and raters to evaluate candidates on various performance dimensions.\n\n2. The \"Leaderless group discussion\" is incorrect because it involves a small group of participants working together to solve a job-related problem without a designated leader, rather than responding to individual communications. A \"Situational interview\" is not the correct answer as it focuses on asking candidates how they would respond to hypothetical situations, rather than evaluating their responses to actual job-related communications.

The correct answer, \"General mental ability test and integrity test,\" is supported by Schmidt, Oh, and Shaffer's (2016) meta-analysis, which found that combining a general mental ability test with an integrity test produces the greatest gain in validity for predicting job performance. This combination enhances the predictive accuracy by leveraging the strengths of both methods, where the general mental ability test assesses cognitive capabilities and the integrity test evaluates the likelihood of counterproductive behaviors.\n\n2. \n- **General mental ability test and personality test:** This combination does not yield the highest gain in validity, as the meta-analysis specifically highlights the superior validity gain achieved when combining general mental ability with integrity tests rather than personality tests.\n- **Interview and work sample test:** While both are valid predictors, their combination does not produce the greatest gain in validity compared to the combination of general mental ability and integrity tests, as indicated by the research findings.\n- **Personality test and biographical information:** Similar to the previous options, this pairing lacks the empirical support for producing the highest validity gain, as the focus of the meta-analysis is on the combination of general mental ability and integrity tests, which outperforms other combinations.",

The correct answer, \"To reduce turnover by setting accurate job expectations,\" aligns with the concept of a realistic job preview (RJP), which involves informing job applicants about both the positive and negative aspects of the job. By providing a clear and honest depiction of the job, an RJP helps ensure that candidates have realistic expectations, which can lead to higher job satisfaction and lower turnover rates after hiring.\n\n2. The option \"To provide intensive training during selection\" is incorrect because a realistic job preview does not focus on training but rather on giving candidates an understanding of the job's realities. The option \"To simulate actual job tasks for skill assessment\" is wrong as well; while work samples are used for skill assessment, an RJP is about conveying job expectations, not evaluating skills.
