      "answer": "Affective disposition",
      "explanation": "1. \"Affective disposition\" is the correct answer because it refers to an individual's tendency to respond to various situations in a consistently favorable or unfavorable manner. According to Judge and Hulin (1993), this disposition contributes to the stability of job satisfaction over time and across different jobs, indicating that individuals with a positive affective disposition are likely to maintain higher levels of job satisfaction regardless of their work environment.\n\n2. \n- **Perceived organizational justice:** This option is incorrect because while perceived organizational justice relates to fairness in the workplace and can influence job satisfaction, it does not directly account for the individual stability of job satisfaction over time and across jobs, as affective disposition does.\n- **Work-family conflict:** This is incorrect as work-family conflict refers to the stress arising from competing demands of work and personal life, which can negatively impact job satisfaction but does not contribute to its stability across different jobs.\n- **Type A behavior pattern:** This option is wrong because the Type A behavior pattern is associated with increased susceptibility to stress and negative outcomes, rather than contributing to the stability of job satisfaction over time and across various jobs.",

This type of justice focuses on how decisions are made and the processes involved in reaching those decisions, which directly impacts employees' perceptions of fairness in the workplace.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- **Interactional justice:** This type refers to the fairness of the way outcomes are communicated to workers, focusing on interpersonal treatment and the quality of information provided, rather than the procedures used to determine those outcomes.\n  \n- **Distributive justice:** This type concerns the fairness of the distribution of resources and outcomes themselves, rather than the processes or procedures that lead to those distributions.\n  \n- **Normative justice:** While not explicitly defined in the reference material, it generally relates to the moral obligations and loyalty employees feel towards their organization, which does not pertain to the fairness of procedures used in decision-making.",

      "answer": "Affective commitment",
      "explanation": "1. **Affective Commitment** is the correct answer because it represents the extent of an employee's emotional attachment to the organization. Research indicates that affective commitment is most highly and consistently correlated with various positive job outcomes, including job satisfaction and performance, as highlighted by Meyer, Stanley, Herscovitch, and Topolnytsky (2002).\n\n2. **Continuance Commitment** is incorrect because it focuses on the extent to which employees feel they must stay with the organization for financial reasons or due to a lack of alternatives, which does not inherently foster positive job outcomes. **Normative Commitment** is also incorrect as it pertains to the sense of obligation or loyalty to the organization, which may not translate into the same level of satisfaction and performance as affective commitment.

      "explanation": "1. **Cortisol** is the correct answer because it is released by the adrenal cortex during the resistance stage of the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) to help maintain energy levels as the body copes with prolonged stress. Elevated cortisol levels allow the body to sustain high energy and manage stressors effectively, as outlined in the reference material.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n   - **Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)**: Although ACTH is involved in the stress response by stimulating the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, it is not the hormone that directly helps maintain energy; rather, it acts as a trigger for cortisol release.\n   - **Epinephrine**: This hormone is released by the adrenal medulla during the alarm reaction stage of GAS and is primarily responsible for the immediate fight-or-flight response, rather than sustaining energy during prolonged stress.\n   - **Norepinephrine**: Similar to epinephrine, norepinephrine is released during the alarm reaction stage and contributes to the initial stress response, but it does not play a role in maintaining energy levels during the resistance stage.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Reduced commitment, loss of control, anxiety, and guilt,\" accurately describes the survivor syndrome observed in employees who remain after organizational downsizing. Research indicates that survivors often experience decreased job satisfaction and organizational commitment, a sense of loss of control, and emotional distress, including anxiety and guilt related to being a survivor amidst job losses (Muchinsky, 2012).\n\n2. The option \"Increased motivation and commitment due to survival\" is incorrect because survivor syndrome typically leads to reduced commitment rather than increased motivation. \"Elevated job satisfaction and sense of security\" is also wrong, as survivors often report lower job satisfaction and feelings of insecurity post-downsizing. Finally, \"Indifference about organizational changes\" does not reflect survivor syndrome, as affected employees usually exhibit emotional responses such as anxiety and guilt, rather than indifference.",

      "answer": "Hardiness",
      "explanation": "1. **Hardiness** is the correct answer because it is identified by Kobasa (1982) as a personality trait that enhances an individual's resistance to the harmful effects of stress. Hardy individuals possess a sense of control over their lives, a commitment to their work and family, and view challenges as opportunities rather than threats, which helps them cope better with stress.\n\n2. The **Type A behavior pattern** is incorrect because, although it is associated with increased susceptibility to stress and negative health effects, it does not promote resistance to stress; rather, it heightens the risk for stress-related issues. **Low self-esteem** is also incorrect since it is linked to being more affected by stress and less effective in coping, which diminishes resistance to stress. Lastly, **neuroticism** is incorrect because it is characterized by emotional instability and a tendency to experience negative emotions, which increases vulnerability to stress rather than enhancing resistance.",

      "answer": "Hostility",
      "explanation": "1. \"Hostility\" is the correct answer because research indicates that it is most strongly associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease among the characteristics of the Type A behavior pattern. While Type A individuals display traits such as competitiveness and time urgency, it is hostility that has been consistently linked to negative health outcomes, including cardiovascular issues, as noted by Friedman and Rosenman (1959) and further supported by subsequent studies.\n\n2. The option \"Excessive competitiveness\" is incorrect because, while it is a characteristic of Type A behavior, it does not have the same level of association with coronary heart disease as hostility does. \"Time urgency\" is also incorrect; although it contributes to the Type A profile, it is not specifically linked to increased heart disease risk in the same way that hostility is. Lastly, \"Multitasking\" is not recognized as a core characteristic of Type A behavior in the provided reference material and thus does not relate to the increased risk for coronary heart disease.",

      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Organization-based self-esteem (OBSE)**  \nOrganization-based self-esteem (OBSE) refers to employees' perceptions of their value as members of their organization. This construct is significant because it has been linked to job stress; individuals with low levels of OBSE are more adversely affected by stress and tend to cope with it in a more passive manner, whereas those with high OBSE exhibit greater resistance to job stress.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Hardiness:** While hardiness is a personality trait that increases resistance to stress, it does not specifically relate to employees' perceptions of their value within an organization, which is the focus of the question.\n- **Organizational justice:** This construct pertains to the fairness of outcomes and procedures within an organization, but it does not directly address employees' self-perceptions or their resistance to job stress.\n- **Continuance commitment:** This type of commitment refers to an employee's belief that they must stay with the organization for financial or alternative opportunity reasons, rather than their self-esteem or value as a member, making it unrelated to the perception of value in the context of stress resistance.",

      ],
      "answer": "The relationship varies and is moderated by reinforcement contingencies",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The relationship varies and is moderated by reinforcement contingencies,\" reflects the complexity of the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance as highlighted in the reference material. It indicates that while there is a correlation between job satisfaction and performance, this relationship is not consistent across all situations and can be influenced by factors such as how closely pay and other rewards are tied to performance. Research suggests that when reinforcement is linked to performance, the relationship between job satisfaction and performance tends to be stronger, illustrating the moderating role of these contingencies.\n\n2. The option \"Job satisfaction causes performance to improve consistently\" is incorrect because the causal direction between job satisfaction and performance is debated, indicating that satisfaction does not uniformly lead to improved performance. The statement \"Job satisfaction and performance are unrelated\" is wrong as meta-analytic findings demonstrate that there is a correlation, albeit one that varies in strength. Lastly, \"Performance decreases when satisfaction increases\" is incorrect because the evidence does not support a negative relationship; rather, satisfaction can positively influence performance, depending on various contextual factors.",

      "answer": "Exhaustion stage",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Exhaustion stage\" is the correct answer because it represents the final phase of the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) when the body's physiological systems can no longer maintain elevated hormone levels, leading to a breakdown of physiological processes. In this stage, chronic stress has depleted the body's resources, resulting in various health issues and an inability to cope with ongoing stressors.\n\n2. The \"Alarm reaction stage\" is incorrect because it is the initial response to a stressor, characterized by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of stress hormones, preparing the body for a fight-or-flight response. The \"Resistance stage\" is also incorrect, as it occurs after the alarm reaction and involves the body attempting to adapt to the stressor while maintaining some physiological functions, rather than experiencing a breakdown. Lastly, the \"Recovery stage\" is not a recognized stage within the GAS framework; instead, the correct stages are alarm, resistance, and exhaustion, with recovery not being defined in the context of Selye's theory.",

The correct answer, \"Men report more work-to-family interference; women report more family-to-work interference,\" is supported by Schockley et al.’s (2017) meta-analysis, which found that while men and women generally report similar levels of work-family conflict, slight differences emerge in dual-earner couples. Specifically, men tend to experience greater interference from work impacting family life, while women report greater interference from family obligations affecting their work.\n\n2. The option \"Men report more family-to-work interference; women report more work-to-family interference\" is incorrect because it reverses the findings of the research, misrepresenting the type of interference associated with each gender. The option \"Women report more family-to-work interference; men report more work-to-family interference\" is also incorrect for the same reason, as it inaccurately attributes the types of interference to the opposite genders.
