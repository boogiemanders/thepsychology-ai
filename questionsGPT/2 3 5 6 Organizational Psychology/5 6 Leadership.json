      ],
      "answer": "Extraversion and conscientiousness",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Extraversion and conscientiousness,\" is supported by Judge, Bono, Ilies, and Gerehardt’s (2002) meta-analysis, which found that these two traits have the largest correlation coefficients with leader effectiveness, specifically .31 for extraversion and .28 for conscientiousness. These traits are associated with positive leader behaviors, such as being sociable, assertive, organized, and dependable, which contribute to effective leadership.\n\n2. The option \"Neuroticism and openness\" is incorrect because while openness can be beneficial, neuroticism is generally associated with negative outcomes, including increased anxiety and emotional instability, which can hinder leadership effectiveness. \"Agreeableness and openness\" is also wrong; although agreeableness can foster positive relationships, it is not one of the top traits correlated with leader effectiveness as identified in the meta-analysis. Lastly, \"Conscientiousness and neuroticism\" is incorrect because, while conscientiousness is positively correlated with effective leadership, neuroticism is negatively correlated and can impair a leader's ability to perform effectively.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A leader who focuses primarily on task accomplishment and performance goals,\" aligns with the definition of a leader high in 'initiating structure,' as identified in the Ohio State studies on leader behavior. Leaders exhibiting high initiating structure are task-oriented and prioritize achieving performance goals, emphasizing the completion of tasks and organizational objectives over interpersonal dynamics.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"A leader who prioritizes interpersonal relationships and trust with employees,\" is wrong because it describes a leader high in consideration, which is person-oriented rather than task-oriented. The second incorrect option, \"A leader who avoids both task and people orientation,\" is incorrect as it contradicts the concept of initiating structure, which involves actively focusing on task performance. Lastly, the option \"A leader who delegates all decision-making to subordinates\" is incorrect because it suggests a hands-off approach, which does not align with the proactive, task-focused nature of a leader high in initiating structure.",

      "answer": "More participative and transformational leadership",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"More participative and transformational leadership,\" reflects findings from meta-analyses by Eagly and colleagues, which indicate that female leaders are more likely to adopt a participative (democratic) leadership style compared to their male counterparts, who tend to be more directive (autocratic). Additionally, female leaders are found to be more inclined towards transformational leadership, characterized by inspiring and motivating employees while fostering their growth, which contrasts with the more transactional styles often associated with male leaders.\n\n2. \n- **More directive and autocratic**: This option is incorrect because it describes a leadership style more commonly associated with male leaders, who are generally found to adopt a more directive (autocratic) approach, while female leaders are more participative.\n- **Higher use of laissez-faire behaviors**: This is wrong because female leaders are not characterized by laissez-faire behaviors; rather, they engage more actively in leadership through participative and transformational styles.\n- **Management-by-exception with active monitoring**: This option is incorrect as it pertains to male leaders who are more likely to engage in management-by-exception, whereas female leaders tend to focus on transformational leadership, which emphasizes development and support rather than corrective measures.",

      "answer": "Expert and referent power",
      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer Explanation**: \"Expert and referent power\" are identified by French and Raven as the types of power most likely to foster commitment among subordinates. Expert power stems from a leader's knowledge and expertise, which can inspire trust and admiration, while referent power arises from a leader being respected and liked. Both forms of power encourage subordinates to engage willingly and commit to the leader’s vision and goals, rather than merely complying with demands or resisting authority.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options Explanation**:\n   - **Coercive power**: This type of power relies on the ability to impose punishments, which typically leads to resistance rather than commitment.\n   - **Legitimate power**: While based on formal authority and roles, it often results in compliance due to obligation rather than genuine commitment, as subordinates may follow orders without personal investment.\n   - **Reward power**: Although it can elicit compliance through financial or non-financial incentives, it does not inherently foster deep commitment, as subordinates may only perform tasks to gain rewards rather than being motivated by a shared vision or respect for the leader.",

      ],
      "answer": "The leader is task-oriented and describes their least preferred coworker negatively",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The leader is task-oriented and describes their least preferred coworker negatively,\" aligns with Fiedler’s Contingency Model, which states that a low Least Preferred Coworker (LPC) score indicates a task-oriented leadership style. Leaders with low LPC scores focus on the performance and task completion of their least preferred coworker, resulting in negative descriptions, as they prioritize task performance over interpersonal qualities.\n\n2. The option \"The leader is primarily person-oriented\" is incorrect because a low LPC score specifically signifies a task-oriented focus, not a person-oriented one. The statement \"The leader is conflicted about their coworker’s traits\" is wrong because low LPC leaders do not exhibit conflict; they evaluate coworkers based on their task performance, leading to negative perceptions. Lastly, the option \"The leader is flexible and switches between task and person orientation\" is incorrect, as Fiedler posits that a leader’s style is stable and not characterized by flexibility between orientations.",

      ],
      "answer": "Participating leader (low task, high relationship)",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Participating leader (low task, high relationship)\" is the correct answer because, according to Hersey and Blanchard’s Situational Leadership Theory, this style is best suited for subordinates who have high job ability but low willingness. A participating leader emphasizes relationship-building and collaboration, which can help motivate willing employees who may lack confidence or motivation despite their abilities.\n\n2. The \"Telling leader (high task, low relationship)\" is incorrect because it is designed for subordinates who are low in both ability and willingness, focusing primarily on directing tasks rather than fostering relationships. The \"Selling leader (high task, high relationship)\" is also incorrect, as it is intended for subordinates who are high in willingness but low in ability, providing both direction and support, which is not applicable in this case. Lastly, the \"Delegating leader (low task, low relationship)\" is inappropriate because it is meant for subordinates who are high in both willingness and ability, allowing them autonomy without the need for close guidance or relationship focus.",

      "explanation": "1. **Supportive leadership** is the correct answer according to House's Path-Goal Theory, which posits that this style is most effective when subordinates have a high need for affiliation and are experiencing low job satisfaction while performing mundane tasks. Supportive leaders focus on creating a friendly and supportive work environment, which is essential for enhancing the morale and motivation of employees who may feel unchallenged or disengaged.\n\n2. **Directive leadership** is incorrect because it is most effective when subordinates are dogmatic or authoritarian and the tasks are ambiguous and complex, rather than when employees need support in mundane tasks. **Achievement-oriented leadership** is also not suitable, as it is best for subordinates who are motivated and capable, focusing on setting high goals and expectations, which does not align with the needs of those struggling with low job satisfaction. Lastly, **participative leadership** is inappropriate in this context because it is more effective when subordinates are willing and able to contribute to decision-making, which is not the case when they are performing mundane tasks with low engagement.",

      "answer": "Greater job satisfaction, support, and opportunities for responsibility",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Greater job satisfaction, support, and opportunities for responsibility,\" aligns with Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) theory, which posits that in-group members receive more attention and support from leaders. These subordinates are involved in decision-making and are assigned more interesting and challenging tasks, leading to higher levels of job satisfaction and a greater sense of responsibility.\n\n2. The option \"More formal relationships with the leader and routine tasks\" is incorrect because in-group members have closer, more supportive relationships with leaders, not formal ones, and they are given more engaging tasks rather than routine ones. The choice \"Limited participation in decision-making and fewer challenges\" is wrong as in-group members typically participate more in decision-making and face greater challenges due to the trust and support they receive. Lastly, \"Strict performance monitoring and reduced trust\" is incorrect because in-group members experience higher levels of trust and support from their leaders, rather than strict monitoring, which is more characteristic of out-group members.",

      "answer": "Intervening to correct mistakes either actively or passively",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Intervening to correct mistakes either actively or passively,\" accurately describes management-by-exception (MBE) within transactional leadership. Transactional leaders utilize MBE as a strategy to monitor employee performance closely; they may take immediate corrective actions when deviations from standards occur (active MBE) or only intervene when significant issues arise (passive MBE). This approach emphasizes the leader's role in addressing mistakes to maintain performance standards.\n\n2. The option \"Providing employees individualized attention to foster growth\" is incorrect because this characteristic aligns more with transformational leadership, which focuses on personal support and development rather than corrective actions. \"Promoting innovation and creative problem-solving\" is also incorrect, as this is a hallmark of transformational leadership, where leaders encourage creativity and critical thinking, not transactional leadership. Lastly, \"Delegating authority and decision-making entirely to subordinates\" is incorrect because transactional leadership typically involves more direct oversight and control rather than empowering subordinates to make decisions independently.",

Specifically, Judge, Colbert, and Ilies’s meta-analysis found a corrected correlation coefficient of .27, suggesting that intelligence is a significant predictor of effectiveness under these specific conditions.\n\n2. \n- **Emotional intelligence**: While important in leadership, emotional intelligence is not specifically mentioned in the reference material as a predictor of leader effectiveness in conjunction with low stress and directive style.\n- **Agreeableness**: This trait is not highlighted in the reference material as a significant predictor of leader effectiveness; instead, extraversion and conscientiousness are noted for their stronger correlations.\n- **Openness to experience**: Similar to agreeableness, openness is not discussed in the context of predicting leader effectiveness within the provided material, and thus lacks the empirical support found for intelligence.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Reward and legitimate power elicit compliance, expert and referent power elicit commitment,\" aligns with Yukl's (2002) findings on leader power bases. Yukl indicates that reward power, which involves control over rewards, and legitimate power, derived from formal positions, are effective in gaining compliance from subordinates. In contrast, expert power, based on knowledge and expertise, and referent power, stemming from respect and admiration, are more likely to foster commitment among subordinates, leading to higher engagement and motivation.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Coercive power elicits compliance, reward power elicits resistance,\" is wrong because Yukl states that coercive power typically elicits resistance, not compliance, while reward power is associated with compliance. The second option, \"Expert power elicits resistance, coercive power elicits commitment,\" is incorrect as expert power is linked to commitment rather than resistance, and coercive power does not foster commitment. Lastly, the option \"Referent power elicits compliance, legitimate power elicits resistance\" is incorrect because referent power is associated with commitment, and legitimate power is expected to elicit compliance, not resistance.",
