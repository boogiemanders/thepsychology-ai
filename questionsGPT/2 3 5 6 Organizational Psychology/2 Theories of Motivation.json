        "The need to maintain physiological equilibrium",
        "The pursuit of power and prestige",
        "The satisfaction of acquired psychological needs"
      ],
      "answer": "The need to maintain physiological equilibrium",
      "explanation": "1. \"The need to maintain physiological equilibrium\" is the correct answer because Hull’s drive-reduction theory posits that human behavior is primarily motivated by the desire to restore homeostasis. When an innate physiological need is unfulfilled, it creates a state of discomfort or disequilibrium, prompting individuals to engage in behaviors that will fulfill that need and restore balance.\n\n2. The desire for social approval is incorrect because Hull's theory focuses specifically on physiological needs rather than social or psychological motivations. The pursuit of power and prestige is also wrong, as these drives are not related to physiological needs and are not addressed by drive-reduction theory. Lastly, the satisfaction of acquired psychological needs is incorrect because Hull’s theory emphasizes innate physiological needs instead of acquired needs shaped by early experiences, which are discussed in theories like McClelland’s acquired needs theory.",

        "Need for achievement",
        "Need for autonomy"
      ],
      "answer": "Need for power",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Need for power\" because, according to McClelland’s Acquired Needs Theory, individuals with a high need for power are motivated by opportunities to control and influence others, as well as to gain status, prestige, and recognition. This aligns directly with the description of a person seeking status and influence, highlighting their desire for authority and impact over others.\n\n2. The option \"Need for affiliation\" is incorrect because it refers to the motivation to be liked and accepted by others, focusing on relationships rather than influence. \"Need for achievement\" is also incorrect, as it pertains to a desire for success in accomplishing personal goals, emphasizing personal responsibility and performance rather than power over others. Lastly, \"Need for autonomy\" is incorrect because it describes the desire for independence and self-direction, which does not specifically relate to seeking influence or status among others.",

        "Physiological needs",
        "Safety needs"
      ],
      "answer": "Self-actualization needs",
      "explanation": "1. \"Self-actualization needs\" is the correct answer because, according to Maslow’s Need Hierarchy Theory, self-actualization represents the highest level of needs that individuals strive to fulfill. Unlike other needs, which can be satisfied and thus cease to motivate behavior, self-actualization is considered a continual pursuit of personal growth and fulfillment, making it a never fully satisfied motivator.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Esteem needs**: Esteem needs, which include the desire for respect, status, and recognition, can be satisfied and, once achieved, do not continue to motivate behavior in the same way self-actualization does.\n- **Physiological needs**: Physiological needs, such as food, water, and shelter, are the most basic and must be met for survival; once satisfied, they do not remain a continual motivator.\n- **Safety needs**: Safety needs, which involve security and protection from physical and emotional harm, can also be fulfilled, leading to a cessation of their motivating influence once a sense of safety is achieved.",

      ],
      "answer": "They prevent dissatisfaction but do not increase motivation",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"They prevent dissatisfaction but do not increase motivation,\" aligns with Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory, which states that hygiene factors (such as pay and working conditions) fulfill lower-order needs and can lead to dissatisfaction if inadequate. However, the presence of adequate hygiene factors does not contribute to job satisfaction or motivation; only motivator factors can enhance these aspects.\n\n2. The option \"They increase motivation and satisfaction equally\" is incorrect because hygiene factors do not increase motivation; only motivator factors can achieve that. The statement \"They increase motivation but have no effect on dissatisfaction\" is wrong because improving hygiene factors does not enhance motivation, and their absence can lead to dissatisfaction. Lastly, \"They have no impact on either satisfaction or dissatisfaction\" is incorrect because inadequate hygiene factors can indeed lead to dissatisfaction, highlighting their importance in the workplace.",

      "answer": "Task identity",
      "explanation": "1. \"Task identity\" is the correct answer because, according to the Job Characteristics Model, it refers to the extent to which a job requires completing a whole and identifiable piece of work. When employees can see the outcome of their efforts and understand their contributions to the overall project, they experience their work as meaningful, which enhances their motivation and satisfaction.\n\n2. \n- **Autonomy:** While autonomy allows workers to feel responsible for their work outcomes, it does not directly relate to the sense of meaning derived from completing a whole task.\n- **Feedback:** Feedback provides information about performance but does not inherently contribute to the meaningfulness of the work itself; it is more about validating the effectiveness of the work done.\n- **Skill variety:** Skill variety involves using different skills and talents in a job, which can enhance satisfaction but does not specifically create a sense of meaning tied to the completion of a task.",

      ],
      "answer": "It often leads the worker to reduce their work effort or seek better outcomes",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"It often leads the worker to reduce their work effort or seek better outcomes,\" aligns with Adams’ Equity Theory, which states that underpayment inequity occurs when a worker perceives their input-outcome ratio as greater than that of others. This perception of inequity motivates the worker to decrease their work quality and/or quantity or to seek better outcomes, as they feel they are contributing more than they are receiving in return.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"It typically motivates the worker to increase their output,\" is wrong because underpayment inequity actually leads to a decrease in motivation and effort, not an increase. The second incorrect option, \"It has little to no effect on motivation or behavior,\" is incorrect because the theory emphasizes that underpayment inequity has a significant impact on motivation and performance, prompting workers to act to restore equity. Lastly, the option \"It causes the worker to accept work outcomes without complaint\" is also incorrect, as underpayment inequity typically leads to dissatisfaction and a desire to rectify perceived unfairness rather than passive acceptance.",

        "Performance is unrelated to effort but outcomes are highly valued"
      ],
      "answer": "Effort will lead to performance, performance leads to valued outcomes, and outcomes are desirable",
      "explanation": "### Correct Answer Explanation\nThe correct answer, \"Effort will lead to performance, performance leads to valued outcomes, and outcomes are desirable,\" aligns with Expectancy Theory, which posits that a worker's motivation is contingent upon three interrelated beliefs: the expectation that their effort will result in successful performance (expectancy), the belief that this performance will yield certain outcomes (instrumentality), and the value they place on those outcomes (valence). All three factors must be positively perceived for motivation to be high.\n\n### Incorrect Options Explanation\n- **Effort alone guarantees success regardless of performance or outcomes:** This option is incorrect because Expectancy Theory emphasizes the importance of both performance and the perceived value of outcomes, not just effort.\n- **Outcomes are valuable but effort and performance are irrelevant:** This statement is wrong as it disregards the fundamental premise of Expectancy Theory that both effort and performance are critical to achieving valued outcomes.\n- **Performance is unrelated to effort but outcomes are highly valued:** This option is incorrect because Expectancy Theory explicitly states that the belief that effort leads to performance is essential for motivation, making performance directly related to effort.",

      ],
      "answer": "Specific and moderately difficult",
      "explanation": "1. \"Specific and moderately difficult\" is the correct answer because Goal-Setting Theory posits that worker commitment to goals is maximized when the goals are clear and challenging yet achievable. Specific goals provide clarity on what is expected, while moderately difficult goals encourage effort and persistence without overwhelming the worker, thus enhancing motivation and performance.\n\n2. The option \"Vague and easily achievable\" is incorrect because vague goals lack clarity and direction, which diminishes motivation and commitment. \"Assigned without feedback or participation\" is wrong as participation and feedback are crucial for increasing commitment; without them, workers may feel disconnected from the goals. Lastly, \"Highly difficult and unrelated to performance\" is incorrect because overly challenging goals can lead to frustration and disengagement, and goals must be relevant to performance to effectively motivate workers.",

      "answer": "Growth need strength",
      "explanation": "1. \"Growth need strength\" is the correct answer because, according to Hackman and Oldham’s Job Characteristics Model, it moderates the impact of the five core job characteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback) on job outcomes. Workers with high growth need strength, who seek to fulfill higher-order needs, are more likely to experience positive effects on their motivation, satisfaction, and performance when their jobs provide these core characteristics.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- **Need for affiliation**: This need focuses on the desire to be liked and accepted by others, which does not directly influence how the core job characteristics moderate job outcomes.\n  \n- **Need for power**: While this need involves a desire to control and influence others, it does not relate to the moderation of job outcomes as described in the Job Characteristics Model.\n\n- **Need for achievement**: Although this need relates to a desire for success and accomplishment, it is not the specific trait that moderates the effects of the job characteristics on outcomes; rather, it is growth need strength that plays this role.",

      ],
      "answer": "They favor tasks of moderate difficulty and desire clear performance feedback",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"They favor tasks of moderate difficulty and desire clear performance feedback\" is correct because McClelland’s acquired needs theory identifies individuals with a high need for achievement as those who prefer tasks that present a balanced challenge—neither too easy nor too difficult—allowing them to demonstrate their competence. Additionally, these individuals seek clear and frequent feedback on their performance to assess their progress and success in accomplishing their goals.\n\n2. The option \"People with high need for achievement avoid tasks that involve personal responsibility\" is incorrect because individuals with a high need for achievement actually prefer to take personal responsibility for their successes, rather than delegating tasks to others. The statement \"They prefer very easy tasks where success is guaranteed\" is wrong as those with a high need for achievement thrive on moderate challenges, not tasks that are overly simplistic. Lastly, the option \"They are primarily motivated by building relationships and being liked\" is inaccurate because this motivation aligns more closely with individuals who have a high need for affiliation, rather than a high need for achievement, which focuses on personal success and accomplishment.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Designing jobs to provide opportunities for responsibility and advancement,\" aligns with Herzberg's two-factor theory, which emphasizes motivator factors that fulfill higher-order needs. Job enrichment focuses on enhancing job content by providing employees with more responsibility, challenges, and opportunities for personal growth, thereby increasing their motivation and satisfaction at work.\n\n2. The option \"Adding new, similar tasks to reduce boredom\" is incorrect because this describes job enlargement, which merely adds tasks without enhancing responsibility or motivation. \"Increasing pay and benefit packages to prevent dissatisfaction\" is also wrong, as it refers to hygiene factors that address dissatisfaction but do not contribute to job satisfaction or motivation. Lastly, \"Assigning more workers to share workload equally\" is incorrect because it does not enhance individual responsibility or advancement opportunities, which are central to job enrichment.",

      "answer": "Physiological needs create an uncomfortable tension that motivates behavior to reduce it",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Physiological needs create an uncomfortable tension that motivates behavior to reduce it,\" aligns with Hull's drive-reduction theory, which posits that unfulfilled innate physiological needs lead to a state of disequilibrium. This discomfort motivates individuals to engage in behaviors that fulfill these needs, thereby restoring equilibrium and reducing the tension caused by the unmet need.\n\n2. The option \"People strive to maximize positive rewards independent of need states\" is incorrect because drive-reduction theory specifically emphasizes the role of unmet physiological needs in motivating behavior, rather than a focus on maximizing rewards without regard to those needs. The statement \"Individuals are primarily motivated by social approval and belongingness\" is wrong as it reflects concepts more aligned with Maslow's hierarchy of needs and McClelland's acquired needs theory, which address social factors rather than the physiological basis of motivation in drive-reduction theory. Lastly, \"Motivation increases as individuals move higher on a hierarchy of needs\" is incorrect because while this is a principle of Maslow's need hierarchy theory, drive-reduction theory focuses on the tension created by unmet physiological needs rather than a hierarchical progression of needs.",

      "answer": "Increasing work quality or quantity to justify higher reward",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Increasing work quality or quantity to justify higher reward,\" aligns with Equity Theory, which posits that when a worker perceives overpayment inequity—meaning they believe their input/output ratio is less favorable compared to others—they are motivated to enhance their performance. This reaction stems from a desire to restore equity by justifying the higher reward they are receiving, thus aligning their efforts with the perceived fairness of their compensation.\n\n2. The option \"Reducing work effort to match outcomes\" is incorrect because it describes a response to underpayment inequity, where a worker feels they are putting in more effort than they are compensated for and thus reduces their effort. \"Seeking to obtain better outcomes through negotiation\" is also incorrect as it suggests a proactive approach to improve outcomes rather than adjusting performance, which is not typical of overpayment inequity reactions. Lastly, \"Experiencing dissatisfaction but maintaining work levels\" fails to recognize that overpayment inequity typically leads to increased effort rather than dissatisfaction without change, as workers strive to justify their higher rewards.",

The \"Need for achievement\" is incorrect because it pertains to the motivation for success and accomplishing goals rather than forming relationships. The \"Need for power\" is also incorrect, as it focuses on the desire to control and influence others, which is distinct from seeking acceptance and social bonds.
