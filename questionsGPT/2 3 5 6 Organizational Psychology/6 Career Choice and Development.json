      "answer": "Establishment",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Establishment\" because, according to Super’s Life-Space, Life-Span Career Theory, this stage encompasses individuals aged 25 to 44 who are focused on establishing a stable career. During this stage, individuals work on achieving their career goals and solidifying their professional identity, which aligns with the developmental tasks associated with establishment.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Exploration**: This stage involves individuals aged 15 to 24 who are actively exploring different career options and opportunities rather than focusing on establishing a stable career.\n- **Maintenance**: This stage is for individuals aged 45 to 64 who are primarily concerned with maintaining their established careers, rather than establishing them.\n- **Growth**: This stage includes individuals from birth to age 14, who are engaged in developing foundational skills and interests, not in the process of establishing a career.",

      "answer": "Satisfaction and satisfactoriness",
      "explanation": "1. \"Satisfaction and satisfactoriness\" is the correct answer because, according to Dawis and Lofquist's Theory of Work Adjustment, these two factors are essential in predicting job tenure. Satisfaction refers to the employee's contentment with their job based on the match between their needs and the job's reinforcers, while satisfactoriness pertains to the employer's satisfaction with the employee's performance relative to job requirements. Together, these factors determine whether an employee stays in their position or decides to leave.\n\n2. The option \"Satisfaction and adaptability\" is incorrect because adaptability, while important in career development, is not one of the primary factors identified by Dawis and Lofquist as influencing job tenure. \"Skills and motivation\" is also incorrect, as the theory specifically emphasizes satisfaction and satisfactoriness rather than general skills or motivation levels. Lastly, \"Vocational identity and tenure\" is incorrect because vocational identity is not a determining factor in the theory; instead, it focuses on the congruence between employee characteristics and job requirements, which affects job tenure.",

        "The match between personality and work environment"
      ],
      "answer": "The various life roles a person assumes throughout life influenced by personal and situational factors",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The various life roles a person assumes throughout life influenced by personal and situational factors,\" accurately describes Super's concept of 'life-space.' In his theory, Super emphasizes that individuals occupy different roles (e.g., child, student, worker, parent) at various times in their lives, and these roles are shaped by both internal factors (like needs and values) and external factors (such as cultural and situational influences). This dynamic interplay between personal and situational factors creates a unique life-space for each individual, which is central to understanding their career development.\n\n2. The option \"The stage of career development during adolescence\" is incorrect because it narrowly defines life-space as a specific developmental stage rather than encompassing the broader concept of various roles throughout life. The statement \"An individual’s vocational identity clarity\" is also incorrect because vocational identity refers to the clarity of one’s goals, interests, and talents, which is a separate concept from the life-space that focuses on roles. Lastly, \"The match between personality and work environment\" is incorrect as it pertains to Holland's theory of career choice, which emphasizes person-environment congruence rather than the broader life roles that constitute life-space in Super's theory.",

These skills are crucial as they result from interactions among genetic endowment, environmental conditions, and learning experiences, and they directly influence how a person approaches tasks and challenges in their career.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Genetic endowment and special abilities**: This factor refers to inherent traits and abilities that may limit or enhance career choices but does not encompass the skills developed through experiences.\n- **Environmental conditions and events**: This factor pertains to external circumstances that affect career decisions but does not specifically address the skills or problem-solving abilities acquired by the individual.\n- **Instrumental and associative learning experiences**: While this factor involves the learning experiences that contribute to career decisions, it does not specifically focus on the skills and problem-solving abilities that a person develops, which are encapsulated in \"task approach skills.\"",

The correct answer is \"transitory career concept\" because, according to Driver and Brousseau’s Career Concept Model, this concept is defined by individuals who are motivated by a desire for variety and independence, engaging in lateral movements across different occupations every two to four years. This aligns directly with the characteristics described in the question.\n\n2. The \"linear career concept\" is incorrect because it is characterized by a desire for power and achievement, focusing on upward movement with infrequent career changes. The \"expert career concept\" is also wrong as it emphasizes job security and expertise development, involving a lifelong commitment rather than frequent changes. Lastly, the \"spiral career concept\" is incorrect because it involves lateral movements across similar occupations every five to ten years, motivated by personal growth and creativity, which does not match the two to four-year timeframe specified in the question.",

      "answer": "The stability and clarity of an individual’s goals, interests, and talents",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The stability and clarity of an individual’s goals, interests, and talents,\" accurately reflects Holland’s definition of vocational identity. Holland defines vocational identity as a “clear and stable picture” of one’s goals, interests, and talents, which is essential for making confident career decisions. A well-formed vocational identity enables individuals to align their career choices with their personal attributes, leading to greater job satisfaction and productivity.\n\n2. \n- **A preference for one RIASEC personality type over others**: This option is incorrect because vocational identity encompasses a broader understanding of an individual’s goals, interests, and talents rather than merely a preference for a single personality type within the RIASEC framework.\n  \n- **The match between an employee’s skills and job requirements**: This option is wrong as it relates to Dawis and Lofquist’s Theory of Work Adjustment, which focuses on job tenure based on satisfaction and satisfactoriness, rather than the clarity and stability of vocational identity.\n  \n- **A person’s self-concept and life roles**: This statement is incorrect because, while self-concept is a component of Super’s theory, it does not specifically define Holland's concept of vocational identity, which focuses on the clear and stable understanding of one’s career-related attributes.",

      "answer": "Induction, reformation, and integration",
      "explanation": "1. \"Induction, reformation, and integration\" is the correct answer because these stages are specifically identified as part of the implementation phase in Tiedeman’s Career Decision-Making Model. During this phase, individuals begin their chosen job, work on becoming proficient, and strive to balance their own needs with the demands of the organization, indicating active engagement in their career path.\n\n2. The option \"Exploration and crystallization\" is incorrect because these stages belong to the anticipation phase, where individuals explore job options and make tentative choices rather than implementing them. \"Choice and clarification\" is also incorrect as these stages are part of the anticipation phase, focusing on making a job choice and clarifying that choice rather than the execution of a decision. Lastly, \"Anticipation and reflection\" is wrong because anticipation is a phase that precedes implementation, involving exploration and decision-making, while reflection does not correspond to any specific stage within Tiedeman's model.",

      "explanation": "1. **Super’s Life-Space, Life-Span Career Theory** is the correct answer because it emphasizes the interaction between an individual's internal self-concept and external situational factors throughout various life roles and stages. Super posits that a person’s self-concept develops over their lifespan and directly influences career decisions, while also being shaped by different life roles (e.g., child, student, worker) and contextual factors, highlighting the dynamic interplay of personal and environmental influences in career development.\n\n2. **Dawis and Lofquist’s Theory of Work Adjustment** is incorrect because it focuses primarily on the congruence between employee characteristics and work environment, specifically regarding job tenure, satisfaction, and satisfactoriness, rather than the broader interaction of self-concept and life roles. \n\n**Holland’s Theory of Career Choice** is also incorrect as it centers on the fit between personality types and work environments, categorizing them into six types, without emphasizing the life stages and roles that influence self-concept development.\n\n**Krumboltz’s Social Learning Theory of Career Decision-Making** is not the correct answer because it identifies external factors and learning experiences that influence career decisions but does not focus on the internal self-concept or the multi-stage life development aspect that Super's theory highlights.",

      "answer": "Realistic and enterprising",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Realistic and enterprising\" because, according to Holland's Theory of Career Choice, the RIASEC personality types are arranged in a hexagon, with types closest to each other being most similar and those farthest apart being most dissimilar. In this arrangement, realistic and enterprising are positioned at opposite ends of the hexagon, indicating they have the greatest differences in personality traits and work environment preferences.\n\n2. The option \"Investigative and realistic\" is incorrect because these two types are adjacent on the hexagon, meaning they share similarities in their characteristics. \"Artistic and social\" is also incorrect as these types are next to each other on the hexagon, indicating a closer relationship.

The \"Linear career concept\" is incorrect because it emphasizes upward movement and achievement, rather than a commitment to job security and expertise. The \"Spiral career concept\" is also incorrect as it is characterized by lateral movements across similar occupations for personal growth and creativity, not a focus on job security.

The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Instrumental generalizations**: This term refers to beliefs about the consequences of actions taken in the career decision-making process, rather than beliefs about one’s own attributes.\n- **Worldview generalizations**: These involve beliefs about the world and its opportunities, which help predict future events but do not pertain to personal attitudes or skills.\n- **Task approach generalizations**: This category includes beliefs about how to approach tasks and solve problems, focusing on performance standards rather than self-perception of skills and values.",

The \"Assessment phase\" is incorrect because Tiedeman’s model does not explicitly mention an assessment phase; rather, it focuses on anticipation and implementation phases. The \"Implementation phase\" is also incorrect, as it refers to the subsequent stages where individuals begin their chosen jobs and work towards proficiency, rather than the initial exploration and decision-making processes.
