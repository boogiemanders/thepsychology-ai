      "answer": "Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences are more likely to recur.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences are more likely to recur,\" aligns with Thorndike's law of effect, which states that behaviors that yield positive outcomes are reinforced and will be repeated in the future. Thorndike’s experiments with cats demonstrated that the likelihood of a behavior being repeated is contingent upon the satisfaction it produces, leading to a decrease in the time taken to perform the successful behavior over trials.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences are less likely to occur again,\" contradicts the law of effect, which specifically states that satisfying consequences increase the likelihood of behavior recurrence. The second incorrect option, \"Behaviors followed by dissatisfying consequences are more likely to be repeated,\" is incorrect because the law of effect asserts that negative outcomes decrease the likelihood of those behaviors being repeated. Lastly, the option \"The likelihood of a behavior is unrelated to its consequences\" is wrong because Thorndike emphasized the direct relationship between behavior and its consequences, indicating that consequences are fundamental in shaping future behavior.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A behavior increases because a stimulus is removed following the behavior,\" accurately defines negative reinforcement.

The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Variable ratio schedule:** This schedule provides reinforcement after an unpredictable number of responses, which does not apply here since the rat is reinforced after a fixed number of lever presses (15).\n- **Fixed interval schedule:** In this schedule, reinforcement is delivered after a fixed period of time, regardless of the number of responses, which is not the case in this scenario where the number of responses is specified.\n- **Variable interval schedule:** This schedule involves reinforcement after varying and unpredictable lengths of time, not based on the number of responses, which again does not match the scenario where reinforcement is contingent on pressing the lever a specific number of times.",

The \"Variable ratio schedule\" is the correct answer because it provides reinforcement after a varying number of responses, which leads to a high and steady rate of responding. This schedule creates unpredictability in reinforcement, making the behavior more resistant to extinction compared to other schedules, as individuals continue to respond in anticipation of a reward.\n\n2. The \"Fixed ratio schedule\" is incorrect because, although it produces a steady and relatively high rate of responding, it does not offer the same level of unpredictability as the variable ratio schedule, making it less resistant to extinction. The \"Fixed interval schedule\" is also incorrect, as it results in a low rate of responding, with behavior typically increasing only just before the reinforcement period, leading to less overall engagement.

      "answer": "A child is given extra chores for not doing homework.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A child is given extra chores for not doing homework,\" exemplifies positive punishment because a stimulus (extra chores) is added following a behavior (not doing homework), which decreases the likelihood of that behavior occurring again. In this case, the addition of chores serves as a consequence intended to discourage the child from neglecting their homework in the future.\n\n2. The option \"A teenager loses phone privileges after coming home late\" is incorrect because it represents negative punishment, where a privilege (phone access) is taken away to decrease the behavior of coming home late. \"A student avoids detention by submitting assignments early\" is also incorrect, as it describes negative reinforcement; the student is increasing a behavior (submitting assignments) to avoid an unpleasant outcome (detention).

During the extinction process, the individual may exhibit an increase in the behavior as they attempt to elicit the previously reinforcing consequence, leading to the temporary spike in behavior known as an extinction burst.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:  \n- **Spontaneous recovery** refers to the reappearance of a previously extinguished behavior after a period of time without reinforcement, not the initial increase observed during extinction.  \n- **Generalization** is the tendency for a response to occur in the presence of stimuli similar to the original discriminative stimulus, rather than describing a behavior's response to the cessation of reinforcement.  \n- **Habituation** is the process of becoming accustomed to a stimulus, leading to a decrease in response over time, but it does not specifically relate to the initial increase in behavior after reinforcement has stopped.",

This phenomenon occurs when the reinforcement for one behavior (Behavior A) is increased while the reinforcement for another behavior (Behavior B) remains unchanged, resulting in an increase in Behavior A and a decrease in Behavior B. This reflects how changes in reinforcement rates can impact the frequency of competing behaviors.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Two behaviors reinforced at constant rates both increase simultaneously,\" is wrong because it does not involve a change in the reinforcement for one of the behaviors, which is essential for behavioral contrast to occur. The second incorrect option, \"Reinforcement is withheld, leading to a burst in responding,\" is incorrect as it describes an **extinction burst** rather than behavioral contrast, focusing on the effect of withholding reinforcement rather than changing reinforcement rates.

For example, money is considered a generalized reinforcer because it can be exchanged for various primary reinforcers, fulfilling different needs.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"A stimulus that meets basic biological needs, such as food,\" is wrong because it describes a primary reinforcer, not a generalized reinforcer, which relies on secondary associations. The second incorrect option, \"A neutral stimulus that acquires reinforcing properties by pairing with other reinforcers,\" is too vague and does not specify that a generalized reinforcer is specifically associated with a variety of primary reinforcers, rather than just any reinforcer.

The option \"Gradually increasing reinforcement frequency to strengthen behavior\" is incorrect because it describes a method of enhancing behavior through increased reinforcement rather than the gradual removal of prompts.

The option \"Behaviors maintained by punishment rather than reinforcement\" is incorrect because superstitious behavior specifically involves reinforcement, not punishment; punishment decreases behavior rather than increasing it. \"Behaviors that cease when reinforcement is discontinued\" is wrong because superstitious behaviors can persist even after reinforcement stops due to their accidental reinforcement history.

The option \"conditioned stimulus\" is incorrect because, in operant conditioning, a conditioned stimulus typically refers to a stimulus that has been paired with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned response, which is not the case here. \"Negative punishment\" is wrong because it involves the removal of a stimulus to decrease a behavior, whereas the blinking light is not removing anything but rather signaling reinforcement.

The correct answer, \"To gradually decrease the amount of reinforcement to reduce satiation and improve resistance to extinction,\" accurately reflects the purpose of thinning in operant conditioning. Thinning involves transitioning from a continuous reinforcement schedule to an intermittent one, which helps maintain the behavior while preventing the loss of the reinforcing value due to overuse (satiation).

        "A child is scolded for not doing their homework."
      ],
      "answer": "A person takes pain medication to alleviate a headache.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A person takes pain medication to alleviate a headache,\" exemplifies negative reinforcement because the behavior of taking medication increases as it removes the unpleasant stimulus of pain (the headache). In this case, the alleviation of the headache serves as a reinforcing consequence that encourages the individual to repeat the behavior of taking pain medication in the future when they experience similar discomfort.\n\n2. The option \"A worker receives a bonus for completing a project ahead of schedule\" is incorrect because it illustrates positive reinforcement, where the bonus (a positive stimulus) is given to increase the likelihood of the worker completing projects early. The option \"A cat is rewarded with treats for using the litter box\" is wrong as it also represents positive reinforcement; the treats are a positive consequence that increases the likelihood of the cat using the litter box. Lastly, \"A child is scolded for not doing their homework\" is incorrect because it describes a scenario of positive punishment, where the scolding (a negative stimulus) is intended to decrease the behavior of not doing homework, rather than reinforcing any behavior.",
