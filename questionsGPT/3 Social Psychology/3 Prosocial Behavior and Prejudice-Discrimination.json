      ],
      "answer": "Step 3 – Assuming responsibility",
      "explanation": "1. \"Step 3 – Assuming responsibility\" is the correct answer because it specifically addresses the phenomenon of diffusion of responsibility. In this step, a bystander may conclude that others present are willing to assist, leading them to feel less personally responsible for intervening in the emergency situation. This reduction in perceived responsibility decreases the likelihood that they will take action.\n\n2. \n- **Step 2 – Interpreting the event:** This step involves the bystander determining whether the situation is an emergency, which does not directly relate to feelings of responsibility but rather to understanding the urgency of the situation.\n- **Step 4 – Determining how to help:** This step focuses on the bystander’s ability to figure out the appropriate way to assist the victim, which is separate from the decision of whether or not they feel responsible to help.\n- **Step 5 – Deciding whether or not to help:** This step pertains to the final decision to help, which may be influenced by various factors, including evaluation apprehension, but does not specifically address the assumption of responsibility that occurs earlier in the process.",

      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Introducing superordinate goals**  \nIn Sherif’s Robbers Cave study, the introduction of superordinate goals was found to be the most effective intervention for reducing intergroup hostility. Superordinate goals are objectives that can only be achieved through cooperation between competing groups, which fosters collaboration and reduces animosity, as demonstrated by the boys in the study who were able to work together towards common goals after initially being hostile towards one another.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Establishing equal status contact:** While equal status contact is an important factor in reducing prejudice, it was not the primary intervention that effectively reduced hostility in the Robbers Cave study; it was the cooperation towards superordinate goals that proved most effective.\n- **Increasing competition within groups:** This option is incorrect because increasing competition only heightened hostility between the groups, as evidenced by the initial phase of the study where competition led to increased aggression and antagonism.\n- **Separating groups physically:** Separating groups physically does not address the underlying hostility and may reinforce divisions; the study showed that bringing the groups together to work towards common goals was essential for reducing intergroup conflict.",

      "answer": "A bystander assuming that others' lack of action means no help is needed",
      "explanation": "1. \"A bystander assuming that others' lack of action means no help is needed\" is the correct answer because it exemplifies pluralistic ignorance, where an individual misinterprets the inaction of others as an indication that the situation does not require intervention. This phenomenon can lead to a bystander failing to act, believing that since no one else is helping, the emergency is not perceived as urgent or serious.\n\n2. The option \"A person not noticing an emergency due to distraction\" is incorrect because it relates to the first step of bystander intervention, which is noticing the event, rather than interpreting the situation based on others' actions. \"Feeling unable to help because of lack of skills\" is wrong because it pertains to the fourth step, determining how to help, rather than the social influence of others' inaction.

      "answer": "Empathic concern for the other person's welfare",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Empathic concern for the other person's welfare,\" aligns with the empathy-altruism hypothesis proposed by Batson (1991), which asserts that individuals help others primarily because they genuinely care about their well-being. This altruistic motive is driven by feelings of empathy, which motivate people to act in ways that benefit others, rather than focusing on their own needs or desires.\n\n2. The option \"A desire to reduce their own distress\" is incorrect because it reflects the negative state relief model, which posits that people help others primarily to alleviate their own feelings of sadness or guilt rather than from a selfless concern for the other person. \"Social pressure to conform\" is also wrong, as it suggests that individuals help others primarily due to external expectations, rather than out of genuine empathy for the person in need. Lastly, \"Anticipation of external rewards\" is incorrect because it implies that helping behavior is motivated by the expectation of receiving rewards, which contradicts the essence of altruism as described in the empathy-altruism hypothesis.",

      "answer": "Categorizing people into groups and favoring one’s ingroup",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Categorizing people into groups and favoring one’s ingroup,\" aligns with Tajfel and Turner’s social identity theory, which posits that individuals have a natural tendency to categorize themselves and others into groups. This categorization leads to in-group favoritism, where individuals feel positively toward their own group, which can result in prejudice and discrimination against out-group members as a means of enhancing their self-esteem and group identity.\n\n2. The option \"Competition for scarce resources\" is incorrect because it relates to realistic conflict theory, which suggests that prejudice arises from direct competition between groups rather than mere categorization. \"Authoritarian personality traits\" is wrong as it refers to a specific personality type associated with extreme prejudice, not the broader categorization process emphasized in social identity theory. Lastly, \"Unconscious negative feelings about minorities\" is incorrect since it pertains to theories such as aversive racism, which focuses on internalized biases rather than the fundamental group categorization and favoritism that drive prejudice according to social identity theory.",

      "answer": "Aversive racism",
      "explanation": "1. **Aversive racism** is the correct answer because it is characterized by individuals who hold a non-prejudiced self-image and a belief in equality while simultaneously harboring subtle, often unconscious negative feelings about minority groups. This form of racism leads to avoidance of interactions with minority members unless the individual can justify their discrimination on a basis other than race, reflecting an internal conflict between egalitarian beliefs and negative feelings.\n\n2. **Symbolic racism** is incorrect because it involves a belief in egalitarianism paired with the perception that minority groups violate traditional values, leading to opposition against policies aimed at promoting equality, rather than subtle negative feelings. **Ambivalent racism** is not the correct answer because it describes individuals who possess both positive and negative attitudes toward minority groups, resulting in emotional tension, rather than solely unconscious negative feelings. **Overt racism** is wrong as it refers to openly hostile and aggressive attitudes toward minority groups, which is a direct contrast to the subtlety and ambiguity of aversive racism.",

      "answer": "Stereotype threat",
      "explanation": "1. **Stereotype threat** is the correct answer because it refers to the phenomenon where situational factors activate negative group stereotypes in members of low-status groups, leading to impaired performance on tasks relevant to those stereotypes. This effect occurs when individuals feel the pressure to conform to negative expectations, which can increase stress and reduce cognitive resources necessary for task completion.\n\n2. **Self-stereotyping** is incorrect because it refers to the unconscious internalization of stereotypes that individuals apply to their own group, rather than the performance impairment caused by exposure to negative stereotypes. **Scapegoating** is also incorrect, as it involves members of dominant groups discriminating against weaker target groups to vent frustration, rather than the impact of stereotypes on performance. Lastly, **dehumanization** is wrong because it describes an evaluative stance that denies the humanness of outgroup members, which does not specifically relate to the performance effects caused by stereotype activation in stigmatized groups.",

      "answer": "Antipathy toward women perceived as challenging men's power",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Antipathy toward women perceived as challenging men's power,\" accurately defines hostile sexism as described in ambivalent sexism theory. This type of sexism reflects negative attitudes and hostility towards women who are viewed as undermining traditional gender roles or threatening male dominance. Hostile sexism encompasses disdain for women who assert themselves or seek equality, as it is rooted in a belief that men should retain power over women.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"A subjectively favorable attitude offering protection to women in traditional roles,\" describes benevolent sexism, which is characterized by positive but patronizing attitudes toward women who conform to traditional roles, rather than hostility toward those who challenge them. The second incorrect option, \"Neutral attitudes that do not affect behavior,\" mischaracterizes hostile sexism, as it involves strong negative feelings rather than neutrality. Lastly, the option \"A rejection of all gender stereotypes\" is incorrect because hostile sexism does not reject gender stereotypes; rather, it reinforces them by promoting negative views of women who deviate from traditional expectations.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Laws and policies that create race-based inequalities, such as school funding tied to local property taxes,\" exemplifies structural racism as defined by the APA because it refers to systemic practices and policies that produce enduring racial disparities. Structural racism encompasses laws and institutional practices that perpetuate inequalities across various domains, including education, as evidenced by funding mechanisms that disadvantage minority communities.\n\n2. The option \"A teacher treating students unfairly based on race\" is incorrect because it describes interpersonal racism, which involves individual behaviors and attitudes rather than systemic practices. \"Individual holding and expressing overtly racist views\" is also incorrect, as this represents overt racism, which is characterized by explicit hostility and discrimination from individuals rather than structural inequalities. Finally, \"Discriminatory hiring practices by a private employer\" is incorrect because it pertains to institutional racism, which is specific to organizational policies rather than broader societal structures that create systemic racial disparities.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Both White and Black civilians exhibit shooter bias in response times and errors,\" is supported by Correll et al.'s (2002) research, which demonstrated that both groups showed similar levels of shooter bias, evidenced by their faster decisions to shoot armed Black suspects compared to armed White suspects and higher rates of mistakenly shooting unarmed Black suspects. This indicates that shooter bias is not limited to one racial group, but rather affects both White and Black civilians in similar ways.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Police officers do not show any form of shooter bias compared to civilians,\" is wrong because while police officers were found to be better at detecting weapons, they still exhibited racial bias in the speed of their shoot/don't shoot decisions, specifically regarding armed Black suspects. The second incorrect option, \"Only White civilians show shooter bias related to racial stereotypes,\" is incorrect as the research indicates that both White and Black civilians display shooter bias, not just White civilians. Lastly, the option \"Police officers make more errors than civilians when deciding to shoot armed suspects\" is inaccurate because the studies found that police officers had better accuracy in detecting weapons than civilians, suggesting they made fewer errors overall, despite exhibiting shooter bias in response times.",

      "answer": "Contact sanctioned by law or institutional authorities",
      "explanation": "1. \"Contact sanctioned by law or institutional authorities\" is the correct answer because, according to Allport's (1954) contact hypothesis, effective intergroup contact for reducing prejudice occurs when it is supported by legal or institutional frameworks. This endorsement helps create an environment where members of different groups feel safe and encouraged to engage with one another, thus facilitating positive interactions and reducing biases.\n\n2. The option \"Groups competing for limited resources\" is incorrect because competition can exacerbate prejudice and discrimination rather than reduce it, as it creates conflict between groups. \"Contact occurring with unequal group status\" is wrong because unequal status can reinforce existing prejudices and power dynamics, hindering effective interaction. Lastly, \"Avoidance of cooperative activities\" is incorrect because cooperation is essential for achieving common goals, which promotes positive intergroup relations and diminishes prejudice, contrary to the premise of the contact hypothesis.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Attributing fewer secondary, uniquely human emotions to outgroup members than to ingroup members,\" accurately describes infrahumanization because it highlights the process by which people perceive their ingroup as fully human, capable of complex emotions, while viewing outgroup members as less human and more animal-like. This concept is crucial in understanding how dehumanization manifests subtly, leading to reduced empathy and prosocial behaviors toward outgroup members, as outlined by Leyens and colleagues (2001, 2007).\n\n2. The option \"Denying the humanness of outgroup members entirely\" is incorrect because infrahumanization does not imply that outgroup members are considered non-human; rather, it suggests they are viewed as less than fully human. The choice \"Viewing outgroup members as fully human but inferior in status\" is wrong because it contradicts the essence of infrahumanization, which specifically involves a perception of diminished humanity rather than merely a status hierarchy. Lastly, \"Believing ingroup members are less emotional than outgroup members\" is incorrect as it reverses the infrahumanization process; the theory posits that ingroup members are attributed more complex emotions, not fewer, compared to outgroup members.",

      "answer": "The bystander’s current location during the emergency",
      "explanation": "1. \"The bystander’s current location during the emergency\" is the correct answer because research indicates that a bystander is less likely to help a person in distress when the incident occurs in an urban area compared to a rural area, regardless of where the bystander was born and raised. This suggests that the immediate environment plays a crucial role in influencing a bystander's willingness to intervene, primarily due to factors like stimulus overload and the presence of more potential distractions in urban settings (Steblay, 1987).\n\n2. The option \"Where the bystander was born and socialized\" is incorrect because studies suggest that the current location of the bystander has a more significant impact on helping behavior than their background or socialization. \"Whether the bystander has received formal emergency training\" is not a primary factor in the context of urban versus rural settings, as the emphasis is on location rather than training. Lastly, \"The severity of the victim’s injury\" is also incorrect because while it may influence the decision to help, the research primarily highlights the environmental context (urban vs. rural) as the most critical determinant of bystander intervention.",

The correct answer, \"Altruistic helping originates from empathic concern for the other’s well-being,\" is supported by the empathy-altruism hypothesis, which posits that individuals help others primarily out of genuine concern for their welfare.

      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Step 3 – Assuming responsibility**  \n\"Step 3 – Assuming responsibility\" is the correct answer because it specifically involves the bystander recognizing their personal obligation to help despite the presence of others. In this step, the bystander must overcome the diffusion of responsibility, which occurs when individuals feel less accountable for taking action due to the belief that others will intervene. When a bystander feels a personal obligation, it indicates they are actively acknowledging their role in providing assistance.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Step 1 – Noticing the event:** This step involves the bystander recognizing that an unusual event is occurring; however, it does not address the decision to help or the sense of responsibility to intervene.\n- **Step 4 – Determining how to help:** This step focuses on figuring out the appropriate way to assist the victim rather than on the bystander’s sense of obligation to intervene in the first place.\n- **Step 5 – Deciding whether or not to help:** This step pertains to the final decision-making process about whether to provide help, which may be influenced by evaluation apprehension, rather than the initial feeling of personal responsibility to act.",
