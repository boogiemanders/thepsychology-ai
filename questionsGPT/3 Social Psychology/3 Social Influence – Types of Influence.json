      "answer": "Subjects were placed in an agentic state, seeing themselves as agents carrying out another’s wishes",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Subjects were placed in an agentic state, seeing themselves as agents carrying out another’s wishes,\" reflects Milgram's conclusion that participants obeyed the experimenter because they perceived themselves as instruments executing the authority's commands. This agentic state diminished their sense of personal responsibility for the learner’s suffering, allowing them to continue administering shocks despite the apparent harm.\n\n2. The option \"Subjects experienced psychological reactance leading to compliance\" is incorrect because psychological reactance refers to a response where individuals resist perceived threats to their freedom, often resulting in defiance rather than compliance. The statement \"Subjects conformed due to normative social influence\" is also incorrect, as normative social influence involves conforming to group norms to avoid ridicule or rejection, which does not adequately explain the obedience seen in Milgram's study. Lastly, the option \"Subjects received financial incentives to continue\" is wrong because Milgram's study did not involve any financial rewards for participants; rather, it focused on the psychological dynamics of obedience to authority.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"When individuals resist influence because their sense of freedom is threatened,\" accurately describes psychological reactance as outlined in the reference material. Psychological reactance occurs when individuals feel pressured to behave in a certain way, leading them to resist that pressure in an effort to reclaim their personal freedom. This reaction can manifest as doing the opposite of what is requested or acting aggressively toward the source of the influence.\n\n2. The option \"When people conform to group norms to gain acceptance\" is incorrect because it describes normative influence, which involves conforming to avoid ridicule or rejection rather than resisting influence. The statement \"When people accept others’ judgments as correct in uncertain situations\" is also incorrect, as it refers to informational influence, where individuals conform because they believe others have more accurate information. Lastly, \"When individuals comply with requests due to perceived reciprocity\" is wrong because it pertains to the norm of mutual reciprocity in compliance tactics, not to the resistance described by psychological reactance.",

The correct answer, \"Asch found conformity even when the correct answer was obvious and unambiguous,\" highlights a significant distinction in Asch's experiments compared to Sherif's.

      "answer": "Door-in-the-face technique",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Door-in-the-face technique\" is the correct answer because it involves a two-step process where an influencer first makes a large request that is likely to be refused, followed by a smaller, more reasonable request. This technique relies on perceptual contrast, making the second request appear more acceptable after the first larger request, and utilizes the norm of mutual reciprocity, as individuals may feel compelled to agree after the influencer has made a concession.\n\n2. The \"Foot-in-the-door technique\" is incorrect because it starts with a small request that is easily accepted, followed by a larger request, rather than beginning with a large request. The \"That's-not-all technique\" is wrong as it involves adding additional incentives to a request before the person has a chance to respond, rather than using a two-step process of large to small requests.

The correct answer, \"People want to appear consistent in their behavior by agreeing to a larger request after initially agreeing to a smaller one,\" aligns with the explanation for the effectiveness of the foot-in-the-door technique. This technique operates on the principle that once individuals commit to a small request, they feel a psychological pressure to act consistently with that commitment, making them more likely to agree to a subsequent larger request.\n\n2. The option \"People experience psychological reactance and resist the initial request\" is incorrect because psychological reactance occurs when individuals feel their freedom is threatened, leading them to resist requests rather than comply. The statement \"The large initial request makes the smaller request seem more reasonable\" is wrong as it describes the door-in-the-face technique, not the foot-in-the-door technique, which relies on initial compliance with a small request.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"The majority of participants continued delivering shocks at 150 volts, with no significant gender differences,\" reflects Burger's (2009) findings that closely mirrored Milgram's original results. Specifically, Burger found that 70% of participants delivered shocks at 150 volts, which is similar to the 82.5% in Milgram's study, indicating that the tendency to obey authority persists even in more ethically guided research. Additionally, there were no significant differences between male and female participants in their willingness to deliver shocks, aligning with Milgram’s original findings.\n\n2. The option stating \"Participants were significantly less likely to deliver shocks at 150 volts compared to Milgram’s original study\" is incorrect because Burger's results showed no statistically significant difference in obedience levels at that voltage. The statement \"The study found that informing participants fully decreased obedience\" is wrong because Burger's adherence to ethical guidelines did not lead to a decrease in the percentage of participants willing to shock the learner. Lastly, the option \"Participants refused to continue once shocks reached 100 volts\" is incorrect as the data indicated that many participants continued to deliver shocks beyond that point, specifically up to 150 volts.",

This type of influence is particularly relevant in unambiguous situations where individuals may conform publicly without genuinely changing their beliefs or judgments.\n\n2. The option \"Desire to achieve accurate understanding in ambiguous situations\" is incorrect because this motivation aligns with informational influence, where individuals conform due to the belief that others possess more accurate information, particularly in uncertain contexts. The option \"Desire to reassert personal freedom when threatened\" is also incorrect, as it describes psychological reactance, a response to perceived pressure that leads individuals to resist compliance, rather than conforming. Lastly, \"Desire to maintain consistency in behavior\" is incorrect because it pertains more to compliance techniques like the foot-in-the-door approach, where individuals agree to requests to remain consistent, rather than the social dynamics of normative influence aimed at avoiding rejection.",

      "answer": "Having the experimenter deliver commands by phone rather than in person",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Having the experimenter deliver commands by phone rather than in person,\" is supported by Milgram's findings that variations in the experimental conditions influenced obedience levels. When the experimenter was not physically present, subjects were less likely to feel the authority and pressure to obey, leading to decreased compliance in delivering high shocks. This change in the method created a psychological distance that reduced the perceived obligation to follow the experimenter's commands.\n\n2. The option \"Increasing the number of confederates in the room\" is incorrect because the presence of additional confederates does not directly relate to the authority of the experimenter or the obedience levels; it could potentially increase conformity but not necessarily reduce obedience to authority. \n\n\"Allowing the teacher to physically force the learner to answer\" is wrong as this scenario would likely increase the sense of personal responsibility and pressure on the teacher, potentially leading to higher obedience rather than decreased levels.\n\nLastly, \"Having the learner visibly express pain and scream\" is also incorrect because while this might evoke empathy, it does not alter the authority dynamics of the experiment; in fact, Milgram's studies showed that participants continued to obey despite the learner's visible distress.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Refusing to comply with a request after feeling one's freedom to choose was threatened,\" exemplifies psychological reactance as it directly aligns with the concept described by Brehm and Brehm (1981). Psychological reactance occurs when individuals perceive that their freedom to act is being restricted, prompting them to resist the influence by refusing to comply with the request, often as a means of regaining their autonomy.\n\n2. The option \"Agreeing publicly with a friend’s opinion but privately disagreeing\" is incorrect because it describes a situation of compliance without genuine acceptance, rather than a reaction against perceived threats to freedom. \"Conforming to a group’s judgment because the task is ambiguous\" is also incorrect, as it illustrates informational influence, where individuals conform due to uncertainty, rather than reactance against authority or influence. Finally, \"Accepting a smaller request after rejecting a larger one\" is not an example of psychological reactance; instead, it reflects the door-in-the-face technique, where compliance is achieved through a strategic concession rather than a response to a perceived threat to freedom.",
