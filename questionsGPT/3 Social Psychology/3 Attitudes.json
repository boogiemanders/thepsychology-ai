      "answer": "Perceived ambivalence",
      "explanation": "1. \"Perceived ambivalence\" is the correct answer because it is not listed as a component of the health belief model, which identifies specific factors that predict a person’s likelihood of engaging in health-promoting behavior. The model includes perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action, but does not mention ambivalence as a relevant factor.\n\n2. \n- **Perceived susceptibility**: This component refers to a person’s perception of their likelihood of developing a health disorder, making it a crucial factor in determining health-related behaviors.\n- **Perceived severity**: This refers to an individual's beliefs about the seriousness of the consequences associated with a health disorder, influencing their motivation to engage in health-promoting behaviors.\n- **Self-efficacy**: This component describes a person's confidence in their ability to take action to reduce their risk for a disorder, which is essential for fostering health-promoting behaviors.",

      "answer": "Central route, involving thoughtful evaluation of message content",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Central route, involving thoughtful evaluation of message content,\" is accurate because, according to the elaboration likelihood model, attitude change that is strong, enduring, and predictive of behavior occurs through a high level of elaborative processing. This central route is characterized by careful evaluation of the message when the individual perceives the message as personally relevant and has the cognitive ability to process it, leading to a more substantial and lasting change in attitude.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Peripheral route, relying on source attractiveness:** This option is incorrect because the peripheral route involves low elaboration and relies on superficial cues, such as the attractiveness of the source, which does not lead to strong or enduring attitude change.\n- **Peripheral route, relying on message length:** This option is also incorrect as the peripheral route focuses on low-level processing and cues like message length rather than the content, resulting in temporary attitude changes that are not predictive of behavior.\n- **Central route, involving reliance on heuristics:** This option is incorrect because reliance on heuristics pertains to the peripheral route, where individuals make quick judgments based on mental shortcuts rather than engaging in thoughtful evaluation of the message content, leading to less stable attitude changes.",

      "answer": "Latitude of acceptance decreases and latitude of rejection increases",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"latitude of acceptance decreases and latitude of rejection increases\" because social judgment theory posits that as a person's ego-involvement with an issue increases, they become more rigid in their beliefs. This heightened ego-involvement leads to a narrower latitude of acceptance for positions that closely align with their own views, while simultaneously expanding the latitude of rejection for positions that are significantly different from their own.\n\n2. The option \"latitude of acceptance increases and latitude of rejection decreases\" is incorrect because increased ego-involvement does not allow for greater acceptance of differing views; rather, it causes individuals to reject more opposing positions. The choice \"both latitudes of acceptance and rejection increase\" is wrong because an increase in ego-involvement results in a decrease in acceptance and an increase in rejection, not both increasing. Lastly, \"latitude of noncommitment increases while acceptance and rejection remain unchanged\" is incorrect because increased ego-involvement typically reduces the latitude of noncommitment, making individuals less open to considering moderate positions.",

      "answer": "Motivated to change her attitude toward country music or Oscar to restore balance",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Motivated to change her attitude toward country music or Oscar to restore balance,\" aligns with Heider's balance theory, which posits that individuals seek consistency among their attitudes and relationships. In this scenario, Patricia (P) likes Oscar (O) but he dislikes country music (X), which she likes; this creates an unbalanced state that leads to cognitive discomfort, motivating her to adjust her attitudes toward either Oscar or country music to re-establish balance.\n\n2. The option \"Unconcerned because relationships are independent of attitudes toward objects\" is incorrect because balance theory specifically emphasizes the interdependence of attitudes and relationships; discomfort arises precisely because they are connected. The statement \"Motivated to reinforce her liking of Oscar without changing her attitude toward country music\" is wrong because it ignores the necessity of addressing the inconsistency between her liking of Oscar and her fondness for country music, which creates dissonance. Lastly, \"Likely to ignore Oscar’s attitude since it does not affect her attitude\" is incorrect because balance theory asserts that conflicting attitudes within a relational context cannot be easily ignored; they compel the individual to resolve the inconsistency.",

      "answer": "They had insufficient external justification for lying, leading to attitude change to reduce dissonance",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"They had insufficient external justification for lying, leading to attitude change to reduce dissonance,\" is based on Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory. Participants paid only $1 had little justification for their lie about the task being enjoyable, which created cognitive dissonance between their true feelings (the task was boring) and their behavior (lying). To relieve this dissonance, they changed their attitude and rated the task as more enjoyable, as they needed to justify their actions internally.\n\n2. The option \"They were bribed and thus motivated to genuinely enjoy the task\" is incorrect because the participants were not bribed in a way that would create genuine enjoyment; rather, the low payment led to cognitive dissonance. The choice \"They had more positive subjective norms about the task\" is wrong because the study did not indicate that participants had any pre-existing positive beliefs about the task; their enjoyment was influenced by the need to resolve dissonance. Finally, \"They were more cognitively capable of attending to the task\" is incorrect because cognitive capability was not a factor in the results; the difference in enjoyment ratings was due to the level of justification for their behavior, not their cognitive abilities.",

        "Self-serving bias"
      ],
      "answer": "Overjustification effect",
      "explanation": "1. The \"overjustification effect\" is the correct answer because it describes the phenomenon where individuals, particularly children, experience a decrease in intrinsic motivation for an activity when they receive external rewards for it. This effect occurs because the external rewards can lead individuals to attribute their engagement in the activity to the rewards rather than their intrinsic enjoyment, thus diminishing their internal motivation to participate in the activity.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n   - **Cognitive dissonance**: This theory relates to the discomfort experienced when there is an inconsistency between cognitions or between cognition and behavior, not specifically about intrinsic motivation being affected by external rewards.\n   - **Social facilitation**: This phenomenon refers to the tendency for individuals to perform better on tasks in the presence of others, which does not explain the decrease in intrinsic motivation due to external rewards.\n   - **Self-serving bias**: This bias involves attributing successes to oneself and failures to external factors, and it does not address the relationship between external rewards and intrinsic motivation in activities.",

      "answer": "When attitude and behavior are measured at different levels of specificity",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"When attitude and behavior are measured at different levels of specificity,\" is correct because early studies indicated that attitudes are better predictors of behavior when both are assessed at the same level of specificity. When a general attitude is used to predict a specific behavior, the relationship weakens, as the mismatch in specificity makes it difficult to accurately predict behavior.\n\n2. The option \"When attitude is based on direct experience\" is incorrect because attitudes formed from direct experience tend to be stronger and more predictive of behavior, as they are more personally relevant. \"When attitude toward the issue is highly accessible\" is also incorrect since easily accessible attitudes are more likely to influence behavior, as individuals are well-informed and can quickly recall their attitudes when making decisions. Lastly, \"When the issue is relevant to the person’s self-interest\" is incorrect because attitudes that align with a person's self-interests are typically stronger and thus more likely to predict corresponding behaviors effectively.",

      "answer": "Communicator's attractiveness",
      "explanation": "1. \"Communicator's attractiveness\" is the correct answer because it is identified as a peripheral cue in the elaboration likelihood model. The peripheral route involves low elaboration and relies on factors that are not central to the content of the message, such as the attractiveness, likability, or credibility of the communicator, which can influence attitude change without deep processing of the message itself.\n\n2. The \"strength of the argument presented\" is incorrect because it pertains to the central route, where attitude change is based on careful evaluation of the message's content rather than peripheral cues. \"Cognitive ability to process the message\" is also incorrect, as it relates to the central route; individuals with the cognitive ability to engage deeply with the message are more likely to process it thoughtfully rather than relying on peripheral cues. Lastly, the \"relevance of the message to the individual\" is incorrect because it influences the likelihood of using the central route; when a message is personally relevant, individuals are more inclined to engage in thorough processing rather than being swayed by superficial cues.",

      "answer": "They act as motivating triggers that initiate health-related behavior",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"They act as motivating triggers that initiate health-related behavior,\" accurately reflects the role of 'cues to action' within the health belief model. Cues to action are factors that prompt an individual to engage in health-related behaviors, such as advice from health providers or reminders from mass media campaigns. These cues serve as catalysts that enhance an individual's motivation to act in response to potential health threats.\n\n2. The option \"They represent the perceived severity of the health threat\" is incorrect because perceived severity refers specifically to an individual's beliefs about the seriousness of the consequences of developing a disorder, not a trigger for action. \"They reduce perceived barriers to taking action\" is also wrong, as perceived barriers refer to the material and psychological costs associated with taking action, rather than being a motivating trigger. Lastly, \"They reflect the person's confidence in their ability to act\" is incorrect because this pertains to self-efficacy, which is the belief in one's capability to perform a behavior, rather than serving as a cue to initiate action.",

      "explanation": "1. \"The strength of the attitude derived from direct experience\" is the correct answer because attitudes are better predictors of behavior when they are strong. According to the reference material, attitudinal strength is greater when the attitude is based on direct experience and is relevant to the individual's self-interests, making it more likely to influence behavior.\n\n2. The option \"The general positivity of the attitude\" is incorrect because the mere positivity of an attitude does not guarantee its strength or predictive power regarding behavior; it is the strength and relevance of the attitude that matter. \"The amount of time elapsed since attitude formation\" is also wrong, as the reference material does not indicate that time alone affects the strength of the attitude-behavior relationship; rather, it emphasizes the strength and accessibility of the attitude. Lastly, \"The number of different attitudes held by the person\" is incorrect because having multiple attitudes does not inherently strengthen the relationship between any specific attitude and behavior; the focus is on the strength and specificity of individual attitudes.",

If an adolescent has a positive social image of peers who smoke marijuana, they are more likely to feel accepted and willing to try it in social situations where it is present.\n\n2. \n- **Avoid marijuana use due to perceived risks:** This option is incorrect because the prototype/willingness model suggests that a positive social image would increase willingness to engage in the behavior, not avoid it due to risks.\n- **Depend solely on behavioral intentions to decide:** This option is incorrect as the model emphasizes both willingness in social contexts and behavioral intentions, indicating that willingness is influenced by social perceptions rather than solely by intentions.\n- **Ignore peer influences on their behavior:** This option is incorrect because the prototype/willingness model explicitly highlights the importance of peer influences in shaping willingness to engage in behaviors like marijuana use.",
