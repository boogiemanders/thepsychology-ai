      "answer": "Seeking out news sources that align with your political views while ignoring opposing viewpoints",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Seeking out news sources that align with your political views while ignoring opposing viewpoints,\" exemplifies the confirmation bias because it reflects the tendency to seek and pay attention to information that confirms existing beliefs while disregarding information that contradicts them. This behavior aligns with the definition of confirmation bias, which is rooted in the desire to maintain one’s self-concept and beliefs, as noted in self-verification theory.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Remembering events that contradict your beliefs but discounting those that support them,\" is wrong because it describes a different cognitive process where contradictory information is acknowledged but not valued, rather than actively seeking confirming information. The second incorrect option, \"Overestimating the relationship between two unrelated variables,\" does not relate to confirmation bias; it instead describes illusory correlation, where individuals mistakenly perceive a relationship between variables that are not truly connected. Lastly, \"Believing you can influence a random event by your actions\" is incorrect because it illustrates illusory control, which involves the false belief in one’s ability to affect outcomes that are actually random, rather than the selective attention to confirming information characteristic of confirmation bias.",

The \"base rate fallacy\" is the correct answer because it describes the tendency to ignore or underuse statistical base rate information—in this case, national conviction rates—while being influenced by distinctive anecdotal stories of rare wrongful convictions. The jury focuses on these specific cases presented by the defense attorney rather than considering the broader statistical context, leading to a flawed judgment.\n\n2. \n- **Illusory correlation** is incorrect because it refers to the overestimation of the relationship between two variables that are not actually related, such as associating negative stereotypes with minority groups, rather than focusing on statistical information.\n  \n- **Gambler’s fallacy** is incorrect because it involves the belief that past random events influence future outcomes, such as thinking a coin toss will result in tails after several heads, which does not apply to the situation of jury decision-making based on anecdotal evidence.\n\n- **Hindsight bias** is incorrect because it pertains to the tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that one could have predicted the outcome, rather than the error in judgment being made at the time of the jury's decision based on anecdotal information.",

The \"spotlight effect\" is incorrect because it refers to the belief that more people notice our actions and appearance than they actually do, rather than opinions or beliefs. The \"illusion of control\" is also incorrect, as it involves the belief that one can influence events outside of their control, such as superstitions, rather than the perception of shared beliefs.

This type of thinking is particularly likely to occur when the outcome is personally significant, resulting in feelings of regret or relief based on the imagined alternatives (Kahneman & Miller, 1986; Roese & Hur, 1997).\n\n2. **Hindsight bias** is incorrect because it refers to the tendency of people to believe they could have predicted an event after it has occurred, rather than imagining alternative outcomes. \n\n**Anchoring and adjustment heuristic** is not the right answer since it involves estimating values based on an initial starting point and making adjustments, rather than contemplating what could have happened differently.\n\n**Illusory correlation** is also incorrect as it describes the overestimation of the relationship between two unrelated variables, rather than the process of imagining alternative outcomes to past events.",

In this case, the person thinks that choosing a 'lucky number' will enhance their chances of winning the lottery, despite the lottery being a completely random event, exemplifying the illusion of control over an uncontrollable outcome.\n\n2. The **availability heuristic** is incorrect because it involves making judgments based on how easily examples come to mind, rather than a belief in controlling outcomes. The **simulation heuristic** is also not applicable here, as it relates to judging the likelihood of events based on how easily one can imagine the event occurring, rather than believing in personal influence. Lastly, the **conjunction fallacy** is wrong because it pertains to incorrectly estimating the probability of two events occurring together as more likely than either event occurring alone, which does not apply to the belief in a 'lucky number' affecting lottery outcomes.",

The **representativeness heuristic** is incorrect because it involves assessing the likelihood of an event based on how much it resembles a typical case or prototype, rather than the ease of recalling examples. The **anchoring and adjustment heuristic** is also incorrect, as it refers to estimating values by starting with a specific reference point and making adjustments, not by recalling examples.

The correct answer, \"Estimating the probability of two events occurring together as greater than the probability of either event alone,\" accurately describes the conjunction fallacy as explained by Tversky and Kahneman. This fallacy occurs when people mistakenly believe that the likelihood of two events happening together is higher than the likelihood of either event occurring on its own, often because they rely on representativeness rather than logical probability calculations.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Ignoring base rate information in favor of anecdotal evidence,\" describes the base rate fallacy, which involves neglecting general statistical information in favor of specific, memorable examples, rather than the conjunction of events. The second incorrect option, \"Overestimating how easily events can be imagined happening,\" refers to the simulation heuristic, which focuses on how easily one can mentally simulate an event occurring, not the probability of two events occurring together.

The \"spotlight effect\" is incorrect because it refers to the belief that others notice one's actions and appearance more than they actually do, rather than projecting personal outcomes onto others. The \"confirmation bias\" is not applicable here as it involves seeking information that confirms one’s existing beliefs rather than estimating others' experiences based on one’s own.

This phenomenon occurs as people reconstruct their memories to align with the known results, making it seem as if they had a better understanding of the situation beforehand than they actually did.\n\n2. The **base rate fallacy** is incorrect because it involves ignoring or underusing statistical information about the general population in favor of specific case details; it does not pertain to the distortion of memory after an event. **Illusory correlation** is also wrong, as it refers to the overestimation of the relationship between two unrelated variables, which does not apply to the context of memory and prediction accuracy following an event.

The \"gambler’s fallacy\" is incorrect because it involves the belief that past random events affect the outcomes of future independent events, such as thinking a coin toss will be tails after several heads, rather than focusing on previous investments. The \"anchoring and adjustment heuristic\" is also incorrect as it pertains to estimating values based on an initial starting point and making adjustments, rather than the emotional attachment to unrecoverable investments.

The correct answer, \"Overestimating how much others notice our appearance and behavior,\" accurately describes the Spotlight Effect, which occurs when individuals believe that their actions and appearance are more noticeable to others than they actually are. This cognitive bias can lead to heightened self-consciousness, particularly in socially anxious individuals, as they assume that others are acutely aware of their behavior and appearance (Gilovich, Medvec, & Savitsky, 2000).\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Believing that one's thoughts and feelings are transparent to others,\" refers to the Illusion of Transparency, which specifically involves overestimating how well others can discern our internal states rather than our external actions or appearance. The second incorrect option, \"Judging the likelihood of an event based on how representative it is,\" describes the Representativeness Heuristic, which focuses on making judgments based on how closely an example matches a prototype rather than on social perceptions.

This heuristic illustrates how initial information can disproportionately influence decision-making.\n\n2. The \"availability heuristic\" is incorrect because it involves making judgments based on how easily relevant examples come to mind, rather than starting with an initial estimate and adjusting it. The \"simulation heuristic,\" while related to how easily events can be imagined, focuses on how these imagined scenarios influence feelings about the likelihood of an event rather than adjusting an initial estimate.

      "answer": "A person only reads reviews that praise a product they intend to buy.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A person only reads reviews that praise a product they intend to buy,\" illustrates confirmation bias because it demonstrates the tendency to seek and pay attention to information that confirms one's existing beliefs or attitudes about the product. This behavior aligns with the definition of confirmation bias, which involves ignoring information that contradicts one's preconceived notions, thereby reinforcing their initial decision to purchase the product.\n\n2. The option \"A researcher only publishes studies that support their hypothesis\" is incorrect because it describes a form of selective reporting rather than confirmation bias, which focuses on the cognitive processing of information rather than the publication of research findings. The statement \"An individual recalls only the times they were successful in a task, ignoring failures\" is wrong because it pertains to selective memory or cognitive distortion, not the active seeking of confirming information. Lastly, \"A student studies only the topics they are already familiar with for an exam\" is incorrect because it reflects a strategy for studying based on comfort rather than an active effort to confirm existing knowledge or beliefs, which is central to confirmation bias.",

      "answer": "A manager only considers employee feedback that aligns with their own opinions.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A manager only considers employee feedback that aligns with their own opinions,\" exemplifies confirmation bias because it illustrates the tendency to seek and focus on information that supports one’s existing beliefs while disregarding contradictory evidence. This behavior aligns with the definition of confirmation bias, which emphasizes the inclination to pay attention to feedback that confirms one’s attitudes and beliefs, thus undermining objective decision-making.\n\n2. The option \"A scientist reviews literature that contradicts their previous findings\" is incorrect because it involves engaging with information that challenges existing beliefs, contrary to confirmation bias. \"A group discusses a problem and includes diverse viewpoints\" is also incorrect, as this scenario promotes the consideration of varied perspectives, which counters the essence of confirmation bias. Lastly, \"An individual reflects on their past decisions with a critical lens\" is wrong because critical reflection typically involves evaluating and questioning one’s beliefs, rather than selectively focusing on confirming evidence.",
