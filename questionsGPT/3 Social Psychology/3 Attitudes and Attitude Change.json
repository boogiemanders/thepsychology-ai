      ],
      "answer": "Emotional affect associated with the behavior",
      "explanation": "The theory of planned behavior posits that a person's intention to perform a behavior is determined by attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Emotional affect is not one of the three factors.",
