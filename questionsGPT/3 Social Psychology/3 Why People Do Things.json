      "answer": "Overestimating dispositional causes and underestimating situational causes when explaining others' behaviors",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Overestimating dispositional causes and underestimating situational causes when explaining others' behaviors,\" accurately describes the fundamental attribution error as defined by Ross (1977). This error reflects a common cognitive bias where individuals attribute the behaviors of others more to their personality traits or dispositions rather than considering the situational factors that may have influenced those behaviors. This tendency often leads to misinterpretations of others’ actions, particularly in social contexts.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Attributing one's own successes to dispositional factors and failures to situational factors,\" describes the self-serving bias, not the fundamental attribution error. This bias specifically pertains to how individuals evaluate their own actions rather than those of others. \n\nThe second incorrect option, \"Attributing in-group members' negative behavior to situational factors and out-group members' negative behavior to dispositional factors,\" refers to the ultimate attribution error, which focuses on group dynamics rather than individual behavior. It highlights biases in evaluating groups rather than the fundamental attribution error's emphasis on individual attributions.\n\nThe third incorrect option, \"Assuming a group's decision reflects the unanimous opinions of all individual members,\" describes the group attribution error, which concerns misattributions about group consensus rather than the individual attributions involved in the fundamental attribution error. This option misrepresents the nature of the fundamental attribution error by shifting the focus from individual behaviors to group decision-making processes.",

      "answer": "Self-serving bias",
      "explanation": "1. The \"self-serving bias\" is the correct answer because it specifically refers to the tendency of individuals to attribute their successes to internal, dispositional factors while attributing their failures to external, situational factors. This bias serves to protect self-esteem by allowing individuals to take credit for positive outcomes while deflecting blame for negative outcomes onto external circumstances.\n\n2. The \"actor-observer effect\" is incorrect because it describes the tendency to attribute one's own behaviors to situational factors and others' behaviors to dispositional factors, rather than focusing specifically on successes and failures. The \"group attribution error\" is also wrong because it pertains to the erroneous belief that an individual member’s characteristics reflect the group as a whole, rather than individual attribution patterns of success and failure. Lastly, the \"ultimate attribution error\" is not applicable here, as it involves attributing behaviors of in-group and out-group members differently, rather than focusing on an individual’s own successes and failures.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Attributing negative behaviors of out-group members to dispositional causes and those of in-group members to situational causes,\" accurately describes the ultimate attribution error. This error highlights how individuals tend to view the negative actions of those in groups they do not belong to (out-groups) as stemming from their character or personality (dispositional), while they attribute the negative actions of their own group members (in-groups) to external circumstances (situational). This bias is often linked to prejudice and can reinforce stereotypes.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Assuming a group's decisions represent all individual group members’ opinions,\" describes the group attribution error, which involves the belief that an individual member's views reflect those of the entire group, rather than the ultimate attribution error. The second option, \"Attributing one’s own actions to external factors while others’ actions are seen as dispositional,\" refers to the actor-observer effect, which focuses on the different attribution styles we use for ourselves compared to others, rather than the group-based attributions of the ultimate attribution error. Lastly, \"Ignoring situational influences when explaining another person’s actions\" is a general description of the fundamental attribution error, which is about overemphasizing dispositional factors in others' behaviors, rather than the specific group-based attributions involved in the ultimate attribution error.",

      "answer": "Own behavior to situational factors; others' behavior to dispositional factors",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Own behavior to situational factors; others' behavior to dispositional factors,\" reflects the essence of the actor-observer effect, which posits that individuals tend to attribute their own actions to external circumstances while attributing others' actions to their internal characteristics. This tendency arises because we have more insight into our own situations and motivations, leading us to consider external factors for ourselves, whereas we often lack that insight for others and thus rely on dispositional explanations.\n\n2. \n- \"Own behavior to dispositional factors; others' behavior to situational factors\" is incorrect because this option reverses the fundamental premise of the actor-observer effect, misrepresenting how individuals typically attribute their actions versus those of others.\n- \"Own behavior to stable causes; others' behavior to unstable causes\" is incorrect as it does not accurately capture the actor-observer effect; it mixes the concepts of stability and situational versus dispositional factors, which are not the focus of this bias.\n- \"Own behavior to distinctiveness; others' behavior to consensus\" is incorrect because this option incorrectly applies Kelley’s covariation model concepts instead of addressing the actor-observer effect, which specifically deals with the attribution of personal versus others' behaviors.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Assuming a group’s decision reflects unanimous individual agreement, despite contrary evidence,\" accurately describes the group attribution error as defined by Allison and Messick (1985). This error occurs when individuals mistakenly believe that a collective decision made by a group is representative of the beliefs or conclusions of each individual member, even when there is evidence suggesting that the decision was not unanimous. This misattribution can lead to oversimplified views of group dynamics and individual contributions.\n\n2. \n- \"Assuming an individual group member’s beliefs represent the whole group’s beliefs\" is incorrect because it specifically describes the other version of the group attribution error as outlined by Hamill, Wilson, and Nisbett (1980), which focuses on individual member beliefs rather than group decisions.\n- \"Believing individual group members are responsible for collective group failure\" is wrong because it does not capture the essence of the group attribution error, which is about misattributing group consensus rather than assigning blame for failures.\n- \"Attributing negative group behavior to situational causes\" is incorrect as it does not align with the group attribution error; instead, it refers to a different attribution process that considers external factors affecting group behavior, which is not the focus of the group attribution error.",

      "answer": "External, unstable, and specific factors",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"External, unstable, and specific factors,\" aligns with the characteristics of an optimistic explanatory style. Individuals with this style attribute negative outcomes to factors outside of themselves (external), that are likely to change over time (unstable), and that are particular to the situation at hand (specific). This perspective helps maintain a positive outlook by minimizing the perception of personal failure.\n\n2. The option \"Internal, stable, and global factors\" is incorrect because it describes a pessimistic explanatory style, where individuals attribute negative events to enduring personal traits (internal), that do not change (stable), and that affect many areas of life (global). \n\nThe option \"External, stable, and global factors\" is also incorrect since it suggests that negative outcomes are attributed to external factors that are consistent and pervasive, which does not reflect an optimistic outlook. \n\nLastly, \"Internal, unstable, and specific factors\" is incorrect because it combines internal attributions with instability and specificity, which is contradictory to the essence of optimism, as it implies a focus on personal traits that are temporary and situational rather than external influences.",

In contrast, the individual attributes their friend's failure to a lack of ability, demonstrating a shift toward internal attributions for others, which is characteristic of the self-serving bias.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Assuming your group members all agree with your opinion without checking,\" is wrong because it reflects the group attribution error, where one assumes individual group members' beliefs align with the group consensus without verification. The second incorrect option, \"Explaining your late arrival by traffic while explaining a stranger’s lateness by irresponsibility,\" is incorrect as it illustrates the actor-observer effect, where one attributes their own behavior to situational factors and others' behaviors to dispositional factors.

      "explanation": "1. \"An external attribution is most likely\" is the correct answer because, according to Kelley’s covariation model, when consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness are all high, it indicates that the behavior is influenced by situational factors. High consensus means others would behave similarly in the same situation, high consistency indicates the person typically acts this way in similar situations, and high distinctiveness shows they do not behave this way in different contexts, leading to the conclusion that external circumstances are causing the behavior.\n\n2. The option \"An internal attribution is most likely\" is incorrect because internal attributions are made when consensus is low, consistency is high, and distinctiveness is low, which is the opposite of the conditions described in the question. The option \"Attributions are ambiguous and cannot be determined\" is wrong because high levels of consensus, consistency, and distinctiveness provide clear evidence for making an external attribution, rather than ambiguity.
