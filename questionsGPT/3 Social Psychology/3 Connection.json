      "answer": "Other highly anxious participants rather than non-participants",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Other highly anxious participants rather than non-participants,\" aligns with Schachter's (1959) findings that highly anxious individuals prefer the company of others who share their anxiety. His research demonstrated that when given a choice, anxious subjects chose to wait with other anxious participants, as they seek out \"miserable company\" to alleviate their distress through social comparison and shared experiences, rather than waiting alone or with those who are not experiencing similar feelings.\n\n2. The option \"Non-participants rather than other highly anxious participants\" is incorrect because Schachter's study specifically showed that anxious individuals do not prefer the company of non-participants, indicating they seek out those who are similarly anxious. The option \"Alone rather than with any company\" is wrong because it contradicts the findings that anxious individuals prefer to wait with others rather than being alone. Lastly, the option \"Any company regardless of their anxiety level\" is incorrect as Schachter concluded that anxious individuals specifically prefer the company of others who are also experiencing anxiety, rather than any random company.",

      "answer": "Similar attitudes validate our own views and produce positive feelings",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Similar attitudes validate our own views and produce positive feelings,\" aligns with Byrne’s (1971) law of attraction, which posits that there is a positive relationship between attitude similarity and attraction. When we interact with individuals who share similar attitudes, it reinforces our beliefs and creates a sense of validation, leading to positive emotional experiences and enhanced interpersonal attraction.\n\n2. The option \"Similarity leads to less conflict in communication\" is incorrect because, while reduced conflict may be a benefit of shared attitudes, it does not directly explain the attraction itself as outlined by Byrne's law. The statement \"Different attitudes challenge us and increase attraction\" is also incorrect; Byrne's law emphasizes that similarity, not difference, is what fosters attraction. Lastly, \"People imitate attitudes of those they are attracted to\" is misleading, as Byrne's law focuses on the attraction stemming from existing similarities rather than the imitation of attitudes.",

      "answer": "Mildly negative, neutral, or positive",
      "explanation": "1. The mere exposure effect suggests that individuals tend to develop a preference for things simply due to repeated exposure, particularly when their initial reactions are mildly negative, neutral, or positive. This is supported by the reference material, which states that while repeated exposure can enhance liking, it does not apply when initial responses are extremely negative. Therefore, the correct answer is that repeated exposure increases liking primarily when initial reactions are mildly negative, neutral, or positive.\n\n2. \n- **Strongly negative or neutral:** This option is incorrect because the mere exposure effect does not apply when initial reactions are strongly negative; such reactions inhibit the development of liking, regardless of subsequent exposure.\n- **Extremely positive:** This option is wrong because the mere exposure effect is not necessary when initial reactions are extremely positive; individuals are already inclined to like the person without the need for further exposure.\n- **Strongly negative:** This option is incorrect as it aligns with the concept that extremely negative initial reactions prevent the mere exposure effect from increasing liking, as the negative feelings overshadow any potential positive effects of repeated encounters.",

      "answer": "More attractive because the blunder humanizes them",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"More attractive because the blunder humanizes them,\" is supported by the research of Aronson, Willerman, and Floyd (1966), which indicates that when a competent person commits a blunder, it increases their attractiveness. This occurs because the blunder makes them appear more relatable and human, which enhances their likability rather than diminishing their perceived competence.\n\n2. \n- **Less attractive because they lose credibility:** This option is incorrect because the pratfall effect specifically shows that a blunder can enhance attractiveness rather than detract from it, particularly for competent individuals.\n- **More attractive only if the blunder is minor:** This option is misleading; the research does not specify that the blunder must be minor for the effect to occur, as the key factor is the humanizing aspect of the blunder itself.\n- **Less attractive regardless of competence:** This is incorrect because the pratfall effect highlights that competent individuals actually become more attractive after making a blunder, contradicting the idea that their attractiveness would decrease.",

      "answer": "Initially dislike them but later express liking",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Initially dislike them but later express liking,\" aligns with the gain-loss effect, which posits that individuals are more attracted to those who initially show dislike but later change their stance to express liking. This phenomenon occurs because the shift from negative to positive feelings is perceived as more significant and rewarding than consistent positive feelings, enhancing the sense of validation and appreciation in the relationship.\n\n2. The option \"Consistently like them from the beginning\" is incorrect because it does not reflect the dynamic change in feelings that the gain-loss effect highlights; constant liking lacks the emotional intensity that comes from a change in perception. The option \"Initially like them but later express dislike\" is wrong as it suggests a decline in attraction, which contradicts the gain-loss effect that emphasizes attraction resulting from a positive shift in feelings. Lastly, \"Consistently dislike them\" is incorrect because it fails to capture any positive change in feelings, which is essential for the attraction described by the gain-loss effect; a consistent dislike does not foster attraction.",

      "answer": "A partner unexpectedly interrupts the couple’s usual behavioral routines",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A partner unexpectedly interrupts the couple’s usual behavioral routines,\" aligns with Berscheid’s emotion-in-relationships model, which posits that strong emotional reactions arise when one partner's unexpected behavior disrupts the established routine. If the interruption leads to a desirable outcome, it generates positive emotions, while an undesirable outcome results in negative emotions, highlighting the significance of unexpected actions in eliciting strong feelings within intimate relationships.\n\n2. The option \"Partners maintain consistent and expected behaviors over time\" is incorrect because it contradicts the model's premise that strong emotions are elicited by unexpected behaviors rather than consistent actions. \"A partner avoids expressing emotions during conflicts\" is also incorrect, as the model does not suggest that emotional avoidance leads to strong reactions; rather, it focuses on the impact of unexpected behaviors. Lastly, the option \"Couples spend less time engaging in shared activities\" is incorrect because the model emphasizes emotional reactions due to interruptions in routines, not merely the amount of time spent together or the activities engaged in.",

      "answer": "It threatens men's certainty about paternity",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"It threatens men's certainty about paternity,\" is supported by Buss et al. (1992), who found that men respond more strongly to sexual infidelity because it raises doubts about whether they are the biological fathers of their partner's children. This concern stems from an evolutionary perspective, where ensuring paternity is crucial for men to invest resources in their offspring and ensure their genetic legacy.\n\n2. The option \"It reduces financial support from the partner\" is incorrect because the primary emotional response to sexual infidelity is rooted in concerns about paternity rather than direct financial implications. The statement \"Men expect emotional but not sexual exclusivity\" is also wrong, as the research indicates that men are particularly sensitive to sexual infidelity due to paternity concerns, not because of differing expectations about exclusivity. Lastly, \"It violates gender role expectations\" is misleading; while infidelity may conflict with societal norms, the stronger jealous response is fundamentally linked to evolutionary concerns regarding paternity rather than adherence to gender roles.",

      "answer": "Men and women differ in beliefs about whether sexual and emotional infidelity co-occur",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Men and women differ in beliefs about whether sexual and emotional infidelity co-occur,\" aligns with the double-shot hypothesis proposed by DeSteno and Salovey (1996). This hypothesis suggests that men believe emotional involvement does not necessitate sexual involvement, whereas women think that if a man is emotionally involved, he is also sexually involved. This difference in belief explains why men and women experience jealousy differently regarding sexual and emotional infidelity.\n\n2. The option \"Men are more jealous about any form of infidelity\" is incorrect because it oversimplifies the findings, which indicate that men respond more strongly to sexual infidelity while women are more distressed by emotional infidelity. The statement \"Women are indifferent to sexual infidelity but highly distressed by emotional infidelity\" misrepresents the research, as it suggests women have no concern over sexual infidelity, which is not supported by the findings. Lastly, \"Men and women experience equal distress over emotional infidelity\" is wrong because it contradicts the research that shows women respond more strongly to emotional infidelity than men do, highlighting a significant gender difference in reactions to infidelity.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Physical attractiveness signaling health and fertility,\" aligns with Buss's (1989) findings that men across various cultures prioritize physical traits in potential mates. This preference is rooted in evolutionary goals, where men are attracted to women whose physical appearance suggests health and fertility, thereby maximizing their reproductive success.\n\n2. The option \"Industriousness and earning capacity\" is incorrect because these traits are primarily valued by women, as they seek partners who can provide resources to support them and their children. \"Emotional support and nurturing qualities\" is also incorrect, as these characteristics are more commonly associated with women's preferences in mates rather than men's. Lastly, \"High levels of education and intelligence\" is not the primary focus for men according to Buss's research; while these traits may be appreciated, they do not hold the same evolutionary significance as physical attractiveness in male mate selection.",

A low waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of about 0.7 is considered a marker of these qualities, as it is associated with optimal reproductive health and the ability to bear children, aligning with men's evolutionary goals of maximizing their reproductive success.\n\n2. \n- **High socioeconomic status:** This option is incorrect because the preference for a low WHR is based on physical attributes related to health and fertility, not on economic factors or social standing.\n- **Strong maternal instincts:** While maternal instincts are important, they are not directly indicated by physical traits like WHR; thus, this option does not align with the evolutionary basis for men's preferences.\n- **Intellectual capabilities:** This choice is also incorrect as WHR preferences focus on physical attributes rather than cognitive abilities, which are unrelated to reproductive health or fertility indicators.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Individuals with a strong desire for affiliation were more likely to survive and reproduce,\" reflects the evolutionary perspective that the need for affiliation is an innate component of human behavior. According to evolutionary psychologists, those who sought out and maintained rewarding interpersonal relationships had better survival rates and reproductive success, as social connections can provide support, resources, and protection.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Affiliation is learned through cultural norms and socialization,\" is wrong because it overlooks the innate biological basis for affiliation emphasized by evolutionary theories, suggesting that the need for social connection is not solely a learned behavior. The second incorrect option, \"Affiliation results primarily from conscious choice rather than innate drives,\" is incorrect because it disregards the inherent, evolutionary drive for affiliation that influences behavior unconsciously rather than being a purely conscious decision. Lastly, the option \"Desire for affiliation decreases with age due to social maturity\" is misleading as it implies a decline in the fundamental human need for social connections, which is generally maintained or even deepened throughout life rather than diminished.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Refers to a general tendency for likers to be more likable overall,\" accurately describes generalized reciprocity as it pertains to the broader concept of attraction in social relationships. Generalized reciprocity indicates that individuals who express affection or liking are generally perceived as more likable by others, fostering a positive social environment. This contrasts with dyadic reciprocity, which focuses on the mutual liking between specific pairs of individuals, highlighting the difference in scope between the two concepts.\n\n2. The option \"Involves mutual liking within specific pairs of individuals\" is incorrect because it defines dyadic reciprocity rather than generalized reciprocity, which encompasses a broader tendency rather than specific relationships. The statement \"Is unrelated to the degree of attraction between people\" is also wrong, as generalized reciprocity is inherently connected to attraction, suggesting that those who like others are generally more attractive themselves. Lastly, the option \"Suggests that individuals dislike those who like them\" is incorrect because it contradicts the principle of generalized reciprocity, which posits that liking tends to create a favorable perception rather than promoting dislike.",

The correct answer, \"anxious peers,\" aligns with Schachter's (1959) findings, which indicate that highly anxious individuals prefer to wait with others who are also anxious rather than alone or with non-participants. This preference occurs because anxious individuals seek the comfort of those who share their feelings, as suggested by the principle that \"misery doesn’t love any kind of company, it loves only miserable company.\" Thus, in stressful situations, anxious individuals are more likely to engage with peers who can provide mutual understanding and support.\n\n2. The option \"calm individuals\" is incorrect because anxious individuals tend to feel disconnected from those who do not share their anxiety, making it less likely for them to seek comfort in calm individuals. \"No one\" is also wrong, as research shows that anxious individuals prefer the company of others, particularly those who are similarly anxious, rather than isolating themselves. Lastly, \"a mix of anxious and calm individuals\" is incorrect because, while some may seek diverse social interactions, the specific preference highlighted in Schachter's study indicates that anxious individuals specifically gravitate towards those who are anxious, not a mix that includes calm individuals.",
