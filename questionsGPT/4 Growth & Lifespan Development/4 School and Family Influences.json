      "answer": "Contempt",
      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer - Contempt**: According to Gottman and Levenson's research, contempt is identified as the single best predictor of divorce. This behavior is part of their \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,\" which also includes criticism, defensiveness, and stonewalling. Contempt signifies a deep-seated disdain for one’s partner, often leading to escalating conflicts and a breakdown in the relationship, making it a critical indicator of marital dissolution.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options**:\n   - **Stonewalling**: While stonewalling, or withdrawing from interaction, is a negative communication behavior, it is not as strongly predictive of divorce as contempt, which reflects a more active disdain for the partner.\n   - **Criticism**: Criticism involves attacking a partner's character or personality rather than addressing specific behaviors, but it does not have the same level of detrimental impact on the relationship as contempt does.\n   - **Defensiveness**: Defensiveness is a response aimed at protecting oneself from perceived attacks, and while it can contribute to conflict, it lacks the corrosive effect of contempt on the relationship dynamics.",

      "answer": "Emotionally inexpressive (avoidant) pattern",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Emotionally inexpressive (avoidant) pattern\" is the correct answer because it is characterized by couples who avoid conflict and self-disclosure, leading to emotional distance and ultimately, divorce later in the marriage. This pattern contrasts with the emotionally volatile pattern, which tends to lead to earlier divorces due to frequent arguments and escalating conflicts.\n\n2. The \"Emotionally volatile (attack-defend) pattern\" is incorrect because it is associated with frequent arguments, criticism, and contempt, leading to divorce earlier in the marriage. The \"Emotionally expressive (engagement) pattern\" is also incorrect, as it is not mentioned in the reference material and does not relate to the patterns identified by Gottman and Levenson.

      "answer": "Higher socioeconomic status",
      "explanation": "1. **Higher socioeconomic status** is the correct answer because research indicates that individuals from higher socioeconomic groups experience a decreased risk for divorce compared to those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This correlation suggests that financial stability and resources associated with higher socioeconomic status may contribute to more stable marital relationships, reducing stressors that can lead to divorce.\n\n2. The option **younger age at time of marriage** is incorrect because studies have shown that the risk for divorce actually increases with younger age at marriage, indicating that marrying at an older age is a protective factor against divorce. The option **presence of a child before marriage** is wrong as it is associated with a greater risk for divorce, not a decrease, since couples who have children before marriage often face additional stress and challenges. Lastly, **younger age at first cohabitation** is incorrect because initial studies found that cohabiting before marriage was linked to higher rates of divorce, suggesting that younger cohabitation is a risk factor rather than a protective one.",

      "answer": "Increased risky health behaviors and transient health effects",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Increased risky health behaviors and transient health effects,\" accurately describes the impact of divorce on men's health as research indicates that men often engage in riskier health behaviors following divorce and experience health problems that are typically temporary. Specifically, studies show that men may face increased stress, social isolation, and other psychological factors post-divorce, which contribute to these risky behaviors and transient health issues (Liu, 2013).\n\n2. The option \"Economic hardship leading to chronic health problems\" is incorrect because, while economic hardship does affect women's health post-divorce, men typically experience an improved financial situation after divorce, which does not lead to chronic health problems. The statement \"Greater social support improving mental health\" is also wrong, as the research indicates that men often face increased social isolation after divorce rather than enhanced social support. Lastly, \"Steady improvement in psychological well-being\" is incorrect because the research shows that men's health problems post-divorce are often linked to increased stress and risky behaviors, not a consistent improvement in their psychological state.",

      "answer": "Less affectionate and more authoritarian",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Less affectionate and more authoritarian,\" reflects the findings that custodial mothers often exhibit diminished affection toward their children, particularly sons, after a divorce. Research indicates that these mothers may become more authoritarian in their discipline styles, which contrasts with the nurturing approach typically associated with authoritative parenting. This change in parenting style is linked to the emotional and psychological challenges faced by mothers post-divorce, leading to reduced sensitivity and increased preoccupation with divorce-related issues.\n\n2. The option \"Authoritative and nurturing\" is incorrect because authoritative parenting involves high levels of warmth and responsiveness, which custodial mothers are less likely to exhibit after a divorce. \"Indulgent and permissive\" is wrong as this style is characterized by leniency and a lack of structure, which does not align with the more controlling and authoritarian tendencies observed in custodial mothers post-divorce. Lastly, \"Emotionally uninvolved and neglectful\" is not accurate because, while custodial mothers may show less affection, they are often still engaged in their children's lives, albeit in a more authoritarian manner, rather than being entirely uninvolved or neglectful.",

      "answer": "The quality of the parent-child relationship and socioeconomic status",
      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer Explanation**: The quality of the parent-child relationship and socioeconomic status are critical factors influencing child adjustment following divorce. Research indicates that children from low-income families often experience increased risks for academic, behavioral, and emotional problems, primarily due to the financial hardships that follow divorce, particularly affecting custodial mothers. Additionally, a strong parent-child relationship can mitigate the negative effects of divorce, highlighting its importance in child adjustment.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options**:\n   - **The frequency of contact with nonresident fathers**: While contact with nonresident fathers is relevant, research shows that factors such as the father's payment of child support and the quality of the father-child relationship are more significant in affecting children's outcomes than the frequency of contact alone.\n   - **Age at time of parental divorce**: Although age at the time of divorce can influence child outcomes, it does not consistently have as much impact as the quality of the parent-child relationship and socioeconomic status, which are more critical determinants of adjustment.\n   - **Gender of the child**: Gender differences in adjustment exist, but the overall quality of parenting and socioeconomic context are more influential on children's adjustment than gender alone.",

      "answer": "Intimate terrorism",
      "explanation": "1. **Intimate terrorism** is the correct answer because it is characterized by one partner’s use of violence to exert control over the other, often involving a cycle of tension building, acute violent incidents, and a phase of loving contrition. This pattern aligns with Walker’s cycle of violence, where the abuser's motivation is to maintain power and control through escalating aggression and manipulation.\n\n2. **Situational couple violence** is incorrect because it involves violence that is situationally provoked, typically during arguments, and does not necessarily include a desire to control the relationship. **Violent resistance** is also incorrect as it refers to a partner's defensive response to the controlling behavior of the other partner, rather than a systematic use of violence to exert control. Lastly, **mutual violent control** is incorrect because it involves both partners engaging in violence to gain control over the relationship, which differs from the unilateral control seen in intimate terrorism.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Increased stress, anxiety, entitlement, and poor emotional regulation,\" reflects the negative outcomes associated with helicopter parenting. Research indicates that this parenting style leads to high levels of stress and anxiety in children, as well as an increased sense of entitlement and low levels of emotional and behavioral self-regulation. These outcomes arise because helicopter parents over-involve themselves in their children's lives, preventing them from developing autonomy and coping skills necessary for healthy emotional development.\n\n2. \n\n- **Increased autonomy and academic motivation**: This option is incorrect because helicopter parenting is characterized by over-involvement, which actually undermines children's autonomy and can decrease their academic motivation rather than enhance it.\n  \n- **High emotional and behavioral self-regulation**: This is wrong because the research indicates that children of helicopter parents struggle with emotional and behavioral self-regulation, not that they exhibit high levels of it.\n  \n- **Improved social competence and decision-making skills**: This option is incorrect as well; helicopter parenting is associated with poorer social competence and decision-making skills due to the lack of opportunities for children to navigate challenges independently.",

The correct answer, \"No consistent differences in psychological and intellectual outcomes,\" reflects the findings from studies that indicate children raised by gay or lesbian parents do not differ significantly from those raised by heterosexual parents in terms of psychological adjustment, intellectual functioning, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Research shows that the parenting skills of gay and lesbian parents are similar to or even better than those of heterosexual parents, supporting the conclusion that the sexual orientation of parents does not negatively impact child outcomes.\n\n2. \n- **Greater psychological adjustment difficulties**: This option is incorrect because studies have found no consistent evidence that children of gay or lesbian parents experience more psychological adjustment difficulties compared to their peers raised by heterosexual parents.\n  \n- **Lower intellectual functioning**: This option is wrong as research indicates that children raised by gay or lesbian parents do not have lower intellectual functioning than those raised by heterosexual parents, showing similar intellectual outcomes across both groups.\n\n- **Higher rates of gender identity confusion**: This choice is incorrect because the literature suggests that children raised by gay or lesbian parents do not exhibit higher rates of gender identity confusion compared to children raised by heterosexual parents, indicating no significant differences in this area.",

The option \"Having stepchildren who are younger than 9 years of age\" is incorrect because research does not specify age as a significant factor for stepfather adjustment; instead, it highlights the quality of relationships as more crucial. \"Being previously unmarried before current marriage\" is wrong as it does not correlate directly with stepfather adjustment; the emphasis is on the presence of biological children rather than marital history.

      "answer": "Contempt",
      "explanation": "1. **Contempt as the Correct Answer**: According to Gottman and Levenson’s research, contempt is identified as the single best predictor of divorce and relationship dissatisfaction. This behavior reflects a deep sense of disrespect and superiority towards one’s partner, which can escalate conflicts and erode the emotional connection necessary for a healthy relationship. Contempt often manifests through sarcasm, ridicule, or disdain, making it particularly damaging to relationship satisfaction.\n\n2. **Explanation of Incorrect Options**:\n   - **Stonewalling**: While stonewalling, characterized by emotional withdrawal and disengagement during conflicts, can lead to relationship issues, it is more often associated with the emotionally inexpressive (avoidant) pattern and is not as directly linked to immediate dissatisfaction as contempt.\n   - **Criticism**: Criticism involves attacking a partner's character or behavior, which can contribute to conflict; however, it does not have the same pervasive negative impact on relationship satisfaction as contempt, which conveys deeper disrespect.\n   - **Defensiveness**: Defensiveness is a response to perceived attacks and can hinder communication; it is typically a reaction to conflict rather than a primary predictor of relationship dissatisfaction like contempt, which fundamentally undermines respect and trust.",

      "answer": "Contempt",
      "explanation": "1. \"Contempt\" is the correct answer because, according to Gottman and Levenson's research, it is identified as the single best predictor of divorce. Contempt involves a sense of superiority and disdain towards one's partner, which undermines respect and affection, creating a toxic environment in the relationship that can lead to long-term instability.\n\n2. The incorrect options are:\n\n- **Criticism**: While criticism focuses on blaming or attacking a partner's character, it does not carry the same level of emotional devastation as contempt, which erodes the foundation of respect in a relationship.\n\n- **Defensiveness**: This behavior involves protecting oneself from perceived attacks, but it does not inherently convey the same level of disdain and negativity that contempt does, making it less detrimental to long-term stability.\n\n- **Stonewalling**: Although stonewalling, or withdrawing from conversation, can create emotional distance, it is less destructive than contempt, which actively undermines the partner's value and the relationship's emotional connection.",
