      "answer": "Embryonic period (weeks 3 through 8)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is the **embryonic period (weeks 3 through 8)** because this is the stage during which major organs and structures are forming, and exposure to teratogens is most likely to cause significant defects. The reference material indicates that the likelihood of major structural damage from teratogens peaks during this critical period of rapid development.\n\n2. The **germinal period (conception to week 2)** is incorrect because it involves initial cell division and implantation, where exposure to teratogens typically results in an \"all-or-none\" effect, meaning significant damage would prevent implantation altogether. The **fetal period (weeks 9 through birth)** is also incorrect as this stage is characterized by the growth and maturation of already formed organs and structures, where exposure to teratogens generally causes minor defects rather than major structural issues. Lastly, the **first trimester (weeks 1 through 13)** includes the embryonic period, but it is too broad; while teratogen exposure during the embryonic phase is critical, the first trimester also encompasses the germinal period where the risk of major defects is lower.",

The correct answer, \"age of viability,\" refers to the earliest point in gestation, typically between 22 and 26 weeks, at which a premature baby has a reasonable chance of surviving outside the womb. This term is significant because it marks the transition from a fetus that is unlikely to survive without intensive medical intervention to one that can potentially thrive with appropriate care.\n\n2. The option \"embryonic period\" is incorrect because it refers to the stage of prenatal development from the third through the eighth weeks, during which major organs and structures are forming, not the viability of the fetus. \"Fetal period\" is also incorrect as it describes the time from week 9 until birth, focusing on the growth and maturation of already formed structures rather than the specific milestone of survival outside the womb. Lastly, the \"second trimester\" is wrong because it spans weeks 14 through 27 of gestation and does not specifically denote the age at which a fetus can survive outside the womb; it simply describes a broader timeframe in prenatal development.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Exposure usually has an all-or-none effect, either causing failure to implant or no effect if implantation occurs,\" accurately describes the germinal period of prenatal development. During this period, which extends from conception to the end of the second week, if a zygote is exposed to teratogens, the exposure can lead to significant damage that prevents implantation. Conversely, if implantation occurs, it indicates that the exposure likely had little or no detrimental effect on the developing zygote.\n\n2. The option \"It commonly causes specific organ malformations\" is incorrect because organ formation primarily occurs during the embryonic period (weeks 3 to 8), not the germinal period. The statement \"It causes minor physical abnormalities without affecting cognition\" is also wrong, as the germinal period's all-or-none effect means that either significant damage occurs (preventing implantation) or no effect is seen; it does not lead to minor abnormalities. Finally, the option \"The fetus is most vulnerable to teratogen-related brain damage at this stage\" is incorrect because the central nervous system is most susceptible to teratogens during the embryonic and fetal periods, not during the germinal period.",

      "answer": "Autosomal recessive; lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diet",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Autosomal recessive; lifelong phenylalanine-restricted diet\" because phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by two autosomal recessive genes, requiring a child to inherit the PKU gene from both parents to manifest the disorder. The key management strategy for PKU is a lifelong diet low in phenylalanine, as this amino acid cannot be adequately metabolized by individuals with PKU, leading to severe health issues if not managed.\n\n2. The option \"Autosomal dominant; gene therapy to replace defective gene\" is incorrect because PKU is not caused by a dominant gene; it requires both parents to pass the recessive gene for the child to develop the disorder. The option \"X-linked recessive; enzyme replacement therapy\" is wrong because PKU is not an X-linked disorder; it is autosomal, and enzyme replacement therapy is not a recognized treatment for PKU. Lastly, \"Mitochondrial inheritance; supportive care only\" is incorrect because PKU does not follow mitochondrial inheritance patterns, and while supportive care is important, the primary management involves dietary restrictions rather than just supportive care.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Some teratogens exert effects by causing epigenetic modifications that alter gene expression without changing DNA sequence,\" accurately reflects the understanding that certain teratogens can influence how genes are expressed through epigenetic mechanisms.

      ],
      "answer": "Fetal period (weeks 9 through birth)",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Fetal period (weeks 9 through birth)\" is the correct answer because, during this stage, the major organs and structures have already formed, and the brain continues to grow and mature. This period is particularly sensitive to environmental factors, as exposure to teratogens can lead to minor defects or abnormalities, especially in the central nervous system, which is susceptible to significant damage during this time.\n\n2. The \"Germinal period (conception to week 2)\" is incorrect because it is characterized by the initial stages of cell division and implantation, where exposure to teratogens typically results in an all-or-none effect, preventing implantation if significant damage occurs. The \"Embryonic period (weeks 3 through 8)\" is also incorrect; although it is a critical time for organ formation and is sensitive to teratogens, it is primarily during this stage that major structural defects are most likely to occur. Lastly, the \"Second trimester (weeks 14 through 27)\" is incorrect as it occurs after the embryonic period and while the brain continues to develop, the most critical brain development occurs earlier, particularly in the fetal period.",
