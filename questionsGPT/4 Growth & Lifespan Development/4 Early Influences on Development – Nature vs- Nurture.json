      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Polygenic inheritance**  \nPolygenic inheritance refers to characteristics that are influenced by multiple genes, rather than a single gene pair. This is applicable to traits such as height and intelligence, which are determined by the cumulative effects of many genes, reflecting the complexity of developmental influences outlined in the reference material.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**  \n- **Single gene-pair inheritance:** This type of inheritance occurs when a characteristic is influenced by a single pair of genes, typically involving two recessive genes or one dominant and one recessive gene, which does not apply to traits like height or intelligence.  \n- **Sex-linked inheritance:** This refers to characteristics influenced by genes located on sex chromosomes, most often the X chromosome, and does not encompass traits that are polygenic in nature.  \n- **Mitochondrial inheritance:** This involves traits transmitted through mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother, and is not relevant to polygenic traits like height or intelligence that involve multiple genes.",

The correct answer, \"Non-shared environmental influences have a substantial impact on personality, while shared influences have little effect,\" is supported by research indicating that shared environmental factors, such as parenting style and family socioeconomic status, have minimal influence on personality throughout the lifespan.

The correct answer, \"Heritability is low (.10) in low-SES and higher (.70) in high-SES families,\" reflects research findings that indicate the heritability of intelligence is significantly influenced by socioeconomic status (SES).

The first incorrect option, \"Heritability is equally high (.70) in both low- and high-SES families,\" is wrong because it overlooks the substantial difference in heritability estimates based on SES, which indicates that genetics plays a more significant role in higher SES contexts.

The correct answer, \"A period during which environmental exposure is optimal but not absolutely necessary for development,\" accurately describes a sensitive period because it highlights that during these times, certain experiences can enhance development, but their absence does not preclude it. Sensitive periods allow for more flexibility in development compared to critical periods, where specific environmental exposures are essential for certain developmental milestones to occur.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"A brief time when environmental exposure is mandatory for development to occur,\" is wrong because it describes a critical period rather than a sensitive period, emphasizing a necessity rather than an optimal condition. The second incorrect option, \"A permanent stage where genetic factors override environmental effects,\" is incorrect because it misrepresents the interaction between genetics and environment, suggesting that genetic factors can completely negate environmental influences, which is not the case in human development.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Changes in gene expression without alteration of the DNA sequence,\" accurately reflects the definition of epigenetics as outlined in the reference material. Epigenetics studies modifications that affect how genes are expressed without changing the actual genetic code (DNA). This means that environmental factors can lead to changes in phenotype through mechanisms like DNA methylation, which can influence gene expression while keeping the underlying DNA sequence intact.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Mutations in DNA sequence causing permanent genetic changes,\" is wrong because epigenetics focuses on changes in gene expression rather than permanent alterations to the DNA sequence itself. The second incorrect option, \"Inheritance of mitochondrial DNA exclusively from the mother,\" is incorrect as it pertains to a specific type of genetic inheritance rather than the broader concept of gene expression changes studied in epigenetics.

The correct answer, \"Increased risk for coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes in adulthood,\" aligns with Barker’s fetal origins hypothesis, which posits that undernutrition during prenatal development can lead to permanent changes in the structure and function of organ systems. Barker's research indicates that such adaptations can predispose individuals to health issues like coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\n2. The option \"Increased likelihood of developing autism spectrum disorder\" is incorrect because the reference material does not link prenatal undernutrition specifically to autism; it focuses on cardiovascular and metabolic issues. \"Permanent intellectual disability regardless of postnatal environment\" is also wrong, as the material emphasizes that prenatal factors can influence outcomes, but they do not guarantee permanent disability irrespective of the environment.

      "explanation": "1. The correlation coefficient for IQ scores of identical twins reared together is .85, indicating a very strong genetic influence on intelligence. This high correlation suggests that identical twins, who share 100% of their genetic material, have similar IQ scores largely due to their genetic similarities, supporting the conclusion that genetics play a substantial role in intelligence.\n\n2. The correlation coefficient for adoptive siblings reared together is .31, which indicates a low correlation and suggests that environmental factors have a more significant impact than genetics in this group. The coefficient for biological siblings reared apart is .24, reflecting a weak genetic influence on IQ scores when siblings are raised in different environments, further supporting the idea that shared genetics alone does not account for intelligence.

The option \"It remains constant while genetic influence increases\" is incorrect because research shows that non-shared environmental influences do not remain constant; they actually increase over time, while genetic influences decrease. The statement \"It decreases and shared environmental influence increases\" is also wrong, as shared environmental factors are found to have little or no influence on personality throughout the lifespan. Lastly, the option \"Both shared and non-shared environmental influences remain negligible\" is inaccurate because non-shared environmental influences are significant and increase in importance with age, while shared factors are not negligible but have minimal impact on personality.",

      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer: Polygenic inheritance**  \n\"Polygenic inheritance\" is the correct term because it refers to traits influenced by multiple genes, such as skin color and eye color. The reference material states that most characteristics, including these traits, are polygenic, meaning their expression results from the cumulative effects of several different genes.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options:**\n- **Mendelian inheritance:** This term describes traits influenced by a single gene pair, following the inheritance patterns established by Gregor Mendel, and does not apply to traits influenced by multiple genes.\n- **Chromosomal inheritance:** This term refers to the inheritance of traits related to the structure and number of chromosomes, rather than the influence of multiple genes on specific traits.\n- **Autosomal inheritance:** This term pertains to traits carried on non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) and does not specifically denote the involvement of multiple genes in trait expression.",

      "answer": "Polygenic inheritance",
      "explanation": "1. **Polygenic inheritance** is the correct answer because it refers to characteristics that are influenced by multiple genes, which interact with environmental factors. This concept highlights the complexity of traits such as height, weight, and intelligence, indicating that these traits cannot be attributed to a single gene but rather to a combination of genetic contributions and environmental influences.\n\n2. **Epigenetics** is incorrect because it specifically focuses on changes in gene expression caused by environmental factors without altering the genetic code itself, rather than the interaction of multiple genes with the environment. **Genetic predisposition** is also incorrect as it refers to the inherited likelihood of developing certain traits or behaviors due to specific genes, but does not encompass the broader interaction of multiple genes and environmental influences. Lastly, **heritability** is incorrect because it measures the extent to which genetic differences contribute to observed variability in a trait within a population, but it does not specifically refer to the interaction of multiple genes with environmental factors.",
