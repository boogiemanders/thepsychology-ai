      "answer": "Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is **Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA)** because the teacher is reinforcing a specific alternative behavior—raising her hand—rather than the undesirable behavior of shouting out answers. DRA involves reinforcing an individual when they engage in one or more specified alternative behaviors instead of the undesirable behavior, which aligns perfectly with the scenario described.\n\n2. **Differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior (DRI)** is incorrect because DRI focuses on reinforcing a behavior that cannot occur simultaneously with the undesirable behavior; in this case, raising a hand is not incompatible with shouting. **Differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO)** is wrong because DRO involves reinforcing any behavior other than the undesirable behavior, rather than a specific alternative behavior like raising a hand. **Differential reinforcement of low rates (DRL)** is also incorrect because DRL reinforces the target behavior at or below a specified low rate, rather than promoting an alternative behavior; in this scenario, the focus is on encouraging the alternative of raising a hand instead of reducing the frequency of shouting.",

      "answer": "A child must clean up chairs knocked over after becoming angry",
      "explanation": "1. \"A child must clean up chairs knocked over after becoming angry\" is the correct answer because it exemplifies **overcorrection**, a form of positive punishment. Overcorrection involves applying a penalty following an undesirable behavior—in this case, the child must restore the environment to a better state by cleaning up the mess created by their anger, thereby reducing the likelihood of the undesirable behavior occurring again.\n\n2. The option \"A child loses 15 minutes of video game time for aggressive behavior\" is incorrect because it describes **response cost**, a type of negative punishment, where a specific reinforcer (video game time) is removed to decrease undesirable behavior. \"A child sits in the corner for a few minutes after misbehaving\" is also incorrect as it refers to **time out**, which involves removing all sources of reinforcement for a brief period, making it a form of negative punishment rather than positive punishment.

This process allows the practitioner to determine whether the initial hypotheses about what maintains the behavior are correct, thereby gaining insight into the function of the behavior.\n\n2. The option \"To reinforce appropriate alternative behaviors\" is incorrect because the focus of systematically altering antecedents and consequences is to observe the effects on the target behavior, not to implement reinforcement strategies at this stage. The option \"To evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions\" is wrong because evaluation occurs in the final step of the FBA process, not during the systematic alteration phase.

      "answer": "Allowing a child to play video games only after completing homework",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Allowing a child to play video games only after completing homework,\" illustrates the Premack principle because it uses a high-frequency, preferred behavior (playing video games) to reinforce a low-frequency, less preferred behavior (completing homework). This strategy increases the likelihood that the child will engage in the less preferred behavior by making the preferred activity contingent upon its completion.\n\n2. The option \"Giving a child a time-out following an aggressive episode\" is incorrect because time-out is a form of punishment, not a reinforcement strategy like the Premack principle. \"Extinguishing a behavior by ignoring it consistently\" is wrong because extinction involves withholding reinforcement rather than using a preferred behavior to reinforce a less preferred one.

      "answer": "Time out should be discontinued even if the individual continues the undesirable behavior",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Time out should be discontinued even if the individual continues the undesirable behavior\" is FALSE because time out should not be ended until the individual is no longer engaging in the undesirable behavior. This means that the intervention must be consistently applied and should not be prematurely terminated, even if the behavior persists during the time out period.\n\n2. The option \"Time out involves removing reinforcement immediately following an undesirable behavior\" is incorrect because it accurately reflects the definition of time out, which is to remove all sources of reinforcement right after the undesirable behavior occurs. The statement \"The individual should be informed about the behaviors that will lead to time out and its duration\" is also incorrect because it correctly describes an important factor for the effectiveness of time out, ensuring that the individual understands the consequences of their actions.

In this case, the parent stops responding to the child's whining, which had previously resulted in attention, thereby removing the reinforcement that maintained the whining behavior.\n\n2. The option \"Positive punishment\" is incorrect because it involves applying a penalty following an undesirable behavior to decrease that behavior, which is not the case here since the parent is not applying a penalty but rather stopping reinforcement. \"Differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior\" is incorrect because it specifically involves reinforcing a behavior that is incompatible with the undesirable behavior, rather than simply withholding reinforcement. Lastly, \"Response cost\" is incorrect because it refers to removing a specific reinforcer following a behavior to decrease that behavior, whereas in this scenario, the parent is not removing a reinforcer but stopping attention altogether.",

      "answer": "Training begins with the last behavior in the sequence and moves backward",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Training begins with the last behavior in the sequence and moves backward,\" accurately describes backward chaining because this method starts with teaching the final response in a behavior chain first. Once the learner masters this last step, the trainer then teaches the preceding step in the sequence, continuing backward until the entire behavior chain is learned. This approach emphasizes the importance of the final behavior as a reinforcement for learning the earlier steps.\n\n2. The option \"Each response is reinforced only after the entire sequence is completed\" is incorrect because, in backward chaining, each response is reinforced immediately after it is mastered, not after the entire sequence is performed. The statement \"Only the final target behavior is important, intermediate behaviors are ignored\" is misleading; while the final behavior is crucial, each intermediate behavior is also essential as it contributes to the overall sequence.

The option \"Providing an aversive stimulus to decrease behavior\" is incorrect because this describes positive punishment, where an unpleasant stimulus is introduced rather than a reinforcer being removed. The option \"Withholding all reinforcement following the behavior\" is wrong because it describes operant extinction, which involves stopping all reinforcement, not just a specific reinforcer.

The correct answer, \"Reinforcing a child for asking three or fewer questions during a 60-minute period,\" exemplifies differential reinforcement of low rates of behavior (DRL) because it involves reinforcing the child when they engage in the target behavior (asking questions) at or below a specified low rate (three questions). This approach aims to reduce the frequency of the behavior by encouraging the child to limit their questions to an acceptable level, rather than eliminating the behavior entirely.\n\n2. The option \"Reinforcing a child for any behavior other than hand-flapping\" is incorrect because it represents differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO), which focuses on reinforcing any behavior other than the undesirable one, rather than specifying a low rate of the same behavior. The option \"Reinforcing a child for raising their hand instead of shouting out answers\" is wrong because it illustrates differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA), which reinforces a different, appropriate behavior rather than controlling the rate of the same behavior.

The option \"Applying punishment immediately after the behavior occurs\" is incorrect because punishment does not address the reinforcement maintaining the behavior and may not lead to a long-term reduction in the behavior. \"Using time out without providing any reinforcement for appropriate behavior\" is wrong because time out alone does not involve the necessary component of reinforcing alternative behaviors, which is essential for effective behavior modification.
