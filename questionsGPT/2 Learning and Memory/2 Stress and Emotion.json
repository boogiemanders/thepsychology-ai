      ],
      "answer": "Physiological reactions to a stimulus preceding the emotional experience",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Physiological reactions to a stimulus preceding the emotional experience,\" aligns with the James-Lange Theory, which posits that an emotional experience arises after a physiological reaction to an emotionally salient stimulus. In this theory, the physiological response, such as increased heart rate or deeper breathing, occurs first, and it is this physiological change that leads to the perception of the emotion, such as fear when encountering a growling bear.\n\n2. The option \"Simultaneous occurrence of physiological arousal and emotional experience\" is incorrect because it describes the Cannon-Bard Theory, which posits that emotional experience and physiological arousal occur at the same time rather than sequentially. The option \"Cognitive appraisal of the situation before physiological response\" is wrong as it reflects Lazarus's Cognitive Appraisal Theory, which asserts that cognitive appraisal occurs before physiological arousal, not after. Lastly, the option \"Attributing physiological arousal to environmental cues\" is incorrect because it pertains to Schachter and Singer's Two-Factor Theory, which emphasizes the role of cognitive labeling of arousal based on environmental cues, rather than the direct physiological response leading to emotion as proposed by the James-Lange Theory.",

      "answer": "Mimicking facial expressions can induce the corresponding emotion",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Mimicking facial expressions can induce the corresponding emotion\" is correct because it aligns with the facial feedback hypothesis, which posits that our facial expressions can trigger physiological changes that are consistent with specific emotions. Research supporting this hypothesis indicates that when individuals mimic facial expressions associated with certain emotions, they tend to actually experience those emotions, such as feeling happy when smiling.\n\n2. The option \"Physiological responses to emotional stimuli occur without conscious awareness\" is incorrect because it does not specifically relate to the facial feedback hypothesis, which emphasizes the role of facial expressions in emotion generation. The statement \"Emotions cause facial expressions that then trigger physiological arousal\" reverses the causal order proposed by the facial feedback hypothesis, which suggests that facial expressions lead to emotional experiences, not the other way around. Lastly, \"Facial expressions are simply outcomes of emotional experiences\" is wrong because it overlooks the active role that facial expressions play in generating emotions, as posited by the facial feedback hypothesis, rather than just being passive outcomes of emotions.",

      "answer": "Emotional experience depends on physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Emotional experience depends on physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation of that arousal,\" accurately reflects Schachter and Singer's two-factor theory of emotion. This theory posits that physiological arousal occurs first and is followed by a cognitive label or interpretation of that arousal, which ultimately leads to the experience of emotion. Thus, both physiological arousal and the cognitive appraisal of that arousal are essential for determining emotional experience.\n\n2. The option \"Each emotion has a distinct pattern of physiological arousal\" is incorrect because Schachter and Singer's theory asserts that physiological arousal is generally similar across different emotions; it is the cognitive interpretation that differentiates the emotions. The statement \"The thalamus sends simultaneous signals to the cortex and autonomic nervous system\" is wrong because this describes the Cannon-Bard theory, not Schachter and Singer's approach, which emphasizes cognitive interpretation following arousal. Lastly, \"Cognitive appraisal occurs only after the emotion is experienced\" is incorrect because Schachter and Singer's theory indicates that cognitive appraisal follows physiological arousal but is necessary for the experience of emotion, not the other way around.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Intensify emotional reactions to a later unrelated event due to misattribution of arousal,\" aligns with Zillman's excitation transfer theory, which posits that residual physiological arousal from one event can enhance the emotional response to a subsequent, unrelated event. This occurs because individuals may misattribute their lingering arousal to the new situation, leading to a heightened emotional reaction that is not solely based on the current context.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Decrease the physiological response to a subsequent unrelated event,\" is wrong because excitation transfer theory suggests that residual arousal actually increases, rather than decreases, emotional responses. The second incorrect option, \"Be fully attributed to the original stimulus regardless of context,\" is incorrect because excitation transfer theory emphasizes that arousal can be misattributed to new stimuli rather than being solely linked to the original event. Lastly, the option \"Cause a gradual dissipation of emotional intensity over time\" is not aligned with the theory, which indicates that residual arousal can persist and even amplify emotional intensity rather than simply fade away.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Evaluating if the event is irrelevant, benign-positive, or stressful and identifying threat, challenge, or harm/loss,\" aligns with Lazarus’s cognitive appraisal theory, which posits that primary appraisal involves assessing an event's significance. During this stage, individuals determine whether the event is benign, irrelevant, or potentially harmful, and if harmful, they classify it as a threat, challenge, or loss, setting the stage for subsequent emotional responses and coping strategies.\n\n2. The option \"Determining available coping options and their likelihood of success\" is incorrect because this process occurs during secondary appraisal, not primary appraisal. The statement \"Monitoring and changing previous appraisals as new information emerges\" refers to reappraisal, which happens after the initial appraisals have been made, making it an incorrect choice for primary appraisal. Lastly, \"Experiencing physiological arousal in response to the event\" is also incorrect, as Lazarus's theory asserts that physiological arousal follows cognitive appraisal rather than occurring simultaneously or prior to it.",

        "To integrate episodic and semantic memory during fear evaluation"
      ],
      "answer": "To quickly react automatically to threatening stimuli and mediate physiological and defensive behaviors",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"To quickly react automatically to threatening stimuli and mediate physiological and defensive behaviors,\" accurately reflects the primary role of the subcortical system in LeDoux’s two-system theory. This system, primarily involving the amygdala, responds rapidly and automatically to threatening stimuli, triggering physiological reactions and defensive behaviors without the need for conscious processing. This immediate response is crucial for survival, allowing for quick reactions to potential dangers.\n\n2. The option \"To process sensory information consciously and generate the feeling of fear\" is incorrect because this function is associated with the cortical system, which involves conscious processing and evaluation of sensory information to determine if a stimulus warrants a fear response. The statement \"To regulate hormonal responses via communication with the pituitary gland\" is also wrong, as this role pertains more to the hypothalamus, which regulates hormonal responses in conjunction with the autonomic nervous system. Lastly, the option \"To integrate episodic and semantic memory during fear evaluation\" is inaccurate because the integration of memory types is a function of the cortical system, which processes information and evaluates the emotional significance of stimuli, rather than the subcortical system that reacts automatically.",

      ],
      "answer": "A catastrophic reaction characterized by depression, anxiety, fear, and paranoia",
      "explanation": "1. \"A catastrophic reaction characterized by depression, anxiety, fear, and paranoia\" is the correct answer because, according to the reference material, areas in the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex are associated with mediating happiness and other positive emotions. Damage to these areas can lead to significant emotional disturbances, resulting in a catastrophic reaction that manifests as depression, anxiety, fear, and paranoia.\n\n2. The option \"An indifference reaction with inappropriate euphoria and lack of emotional response\" is incorrect because this reaction is associated with damage to the right hemisphere, which mediates sadness and negative emotions, not the left. The option \"Increased expression of sadness and negative emotions without cognitive awareness\" is wrong because it does not accurately reflect the emotional outcomes of left hemisphere damage, which primarily affects positive emotions rather than increasing negative emotions. Lastly, \"Loss of all emotional experience including positive and negative emotions\" is incorrect as damage to the left hemisphere does not result in a total loss of emotional experience; rather, it specifically leads to the predominance of negative emotional reactions.",

      "answer": "A stage where physiological functions normalize but cortisol remains elevated to sustain coping",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A stage where physiological functions normalize but cortisol remains elevated to sustain coping,\" accurately describes the resistance stage in Selye’s general adaptation syndrome (GAS). During this stage, while some physiological functions begin to return to normalcy after the initial alarm reaction, cortisol levels remain elevated to help the body maintain energy and cope with the ongoing stressor. This balance allows the individual to manage stress effectively for a period.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"An initial sympathetic nervous system activation releasing energy for immediate response,\" describes the alarm reaction stage, not the resistance stage, where the body first reacts to the stressor with heightened sympathetic activity. The second incorrect option, \"Physiological systems break down due to prolonged stress exposure,\" refers to the exhaustion stage, which occurs after the resistance stage when the body's resources are depleted.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Wear-and-tear on the body and brain increasing risk of physical and psychiatric disorders,\" aligns with McEwen’s allostatic load model, which posits that chronic stress or repeated episodes of acute stress can lead to an allostatic load. This load results in physiological dysregulation, making individuals more vulnerable to various health issues, including physical ailments and psychiatric disorders such as PTSD and major depressive disorder.\n\n2. The option \"Enhanced immune system functioning due to continuous adaptation\" is incorrect because McEwen’s model indicates that chronic stress can lead to dysregulation of the immune system, not enhancement. The statement \"Stable physiological states maintained without any adverse health effects\" is also wrong, as prolonged allostatic states can have negative consequences on health, contrary to the idea of stability.

The correct answer is \"Amygdala\" because it is a key component of the limbic system responsible for recognizing fear in facial expressions and attaching emotions to memories. The amygdala evaluates incoming information to determine its emotional significance and mediates the emotional reaction to it, making it crucial for processing fear-related stimuli.\n\n2. The **Hippocampus** is primarily involved in memory formation and is not directly responsible for recognizing emotions or fear in facial expressions. The **Hypothalamus** regulates the physical signs of emotion through its communication with the autonomic nervous system but does not specifically recognize fear or attach emotions to memories.

      ],
      "answer": "Emotion and physiological arousal occur simultaneously but independently",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Emotion and physiological arousal occur simultaneously but independently\" accurately reflects Cannon-Bard theory because this theory posits that when an environmental stimulus is encountered, the thalamus sends signals to both the cerebral cortex (which processes the emotional experience) and the sympathetic nervous system (which triggers physiological arousal) at the same time. This means that emotional experience and physiological responses do not rely on one another and occur concurrently.\n\n2. The option \"Emotion is experienced only after physiological arousal is perceived\" is incorrect because it aligns with the James-Lange theory, which suggests that physiological arousal precedes and leads to the experience of emotion. The option \"Emotion results from labeling physiological arousal according to situational cues\" is wrong because it describes Schachter and Singer’s Two-Factor Theory, which emphasizes the role of cognitive labeling after physiological arousal. Lastly, the statement \"Cognitive appraisal precedes physiological responses\" is incorrect as it reflects Lazarus’s Cognitive Appraisal Theory, which asserts that emotional responses are based on cognitive appraisal before any physiological changes occur.",

The theory emphasizes that the experience of emotion follows physiological arousal, not the other way around.\n\n2. The option \"Emotional experience occurs before physiological arousal\" is incorrect because it contradicts the James-Lange Theory, which asserts that physiological changes must occur first for emotions to be felt. \"Cognitive appraisal occurs after physiological changes\" is wrong as it misrepresents the sequence in Lazarus’s Cognitive Appraisal Theory, which emphasizes that cognitive appraisal precedes emotional response. Lastly, \"Physiological reactions and emotional experiences occur simultaneously\" is incorrect because it aligns more with Cannon-Bard Theory, which states that both physiological arousal and emotional experience happen at the same time, contrary to the sequential nature of the James-Lange Theory.",
