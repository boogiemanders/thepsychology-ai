      "answer": "Independent variable",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Independent variable\" because the type of therapy given is the variable that the researcher manipulates to observe its effect on reducing depressive symptoms. In this study, the different therapies represent the levels of the independent variable, which aims to determine how they influence the dependent variable, in this case, the severity of depressive symptoms.\n\n2. The \"Dependent variable\" is incorrect because it refers to the outcome being measured, which, in this study, is the severity of depressive symptoms, not the type of therapy. A \"Moderator variable\" is also incorrect because it influences the strength or direction of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables but does not represent the variable being manipulated in the study. Lastly, the \"Mediator variable\" is incorrect because it explains the process through which the independent variable affects the dependent variable, rather than being the variable itself that is manipulated in the research.",

      "answer": "A variable that explains the relationship between an independent and dependent variable",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"A variable that explains the relationship between an independent and dependent variable,\" accurately defines a mediator variable. Mediator variables serve to clarify how or why an independent variable affects a dependent variable by providing an explanatory mechanism within the relationship. For instance, in cognitive therapies, the independent variable (therapy) may lead to changes in dysfunctional thinking (mediator), which subsequently reduces anxiety (dependent variable).\n\n2. The option \"A variable that strengthens or weakens the relationship between two other variables\" is incorrect because this describes a moderator variable, which influences the strength or direction of the relationship rather than explaining it. The statement \"A variable that is manipulated by the researcher to measure its effect\" is wrong because it refers to an independent variable, which is intentionally changed to observe its effect on the dependent variable. Lastly, \"A variable that is an unintended source of influence on study results\" is incorrect as it describes an extraneous variable, which can confound results but does not serve as a mediator in explaining the relationship between independent and dependent variables.",

      "answer": "Extraneous variable",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Extraneous variable\" because noise level is not an intentional part of the study but influences the relationship between the teaching methods (independent variable) and the outcomes (dependent variable). As the noise level varies across groups, it can confound the results, making it difficult to determine whether any observed effects on learning are due to the teaching methods or the noise conditions.\n\n2. The option \"Dependent variable\" is incorrect because the dependent variable is the outcome being measured in the study, such as student performance, rather than a variable that influences the outcome. \"Mediator variable\" is also incorrect because a mediator explains the relationship between the independent and dependent variables; noise does not explain the effect of teaching methods on outcomes. Lastly, \"Moderator variable\" is incorrect because a moderator affects the strength or direction of the relationship between independent and dependent variables, while noise is an external factor that complicates the interpretation of results rather than modifying the relationship itself.",

      ],
      "answer": "Ratio scale",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Ratio scale\" is the correct answer because it is defined as a scale that assigns people to ordered categories with equal differences between adjacent categories and includes an absolute zero point. This absolute zero allows for meaningful statements about ratios, such as concluding that one value can be twice as much as another, which is not possible with other scales.\n\n2. The \"Ordinal scale\" is incorrect because, while it allows for ordered categories, it does not provide information about the magnitude of differences between values, making it impossible to make ratio comparisons. The \"Interval scale\" is also incorrect because, although it has equal differences between values, it lacks an absolute zero, so ratio statements cannot be made (e.g., a score of 0 does not indicate the absence of the characteristic being measured). Lastly, the \"Nominal scale\" is incorrect as it categorizes data into unordered groups without any quantitative value or meaningful way to compare ratios among the categories.",

        "Ratio scale"

      "answer": "Ordinal scale",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Ordinal scale\" because this scale divides individuals into ordered categories that reflect the magnitude of their responses. In this case, the categories 'strongly agree,' 'agree,' 'disagree,' and 'strongly disagree' indicate a ranking of agreement, allowing us to determine that one response is more or less favorable than another, but not how much more or less.\n\n2. The \"Nominal scale\" is incorrect because it categorizes individuals into unordered categories without any inherent ranking or magnitude, such as gender or eye color. The \"Interval scale\" is also incorrect because it involves ordered categories with equal differences between adjacent values, but does not have an absolute zero point, as seen in temperature or IQ scores. Lastly, the \"Ratio scale\" is wrong because it assigns ordered categories with equal differences and an absolute zero point, allowing for meaningful comparisons of ratios, such as weight or height, which is not applicable to the categories of agreement.",

      "answer": "Mode > Median > Mean",
      "explanation": "1. \"Mode > Median > Mean\" is the correct answer for a negatively skewed distribution because, in such distributions, most scores cluster at the higher end, resulting in the mode (the most frequently occurring score) being the highest. The median, which is the middle value, falls next, while the mean, influenced by the lower scores in the tail, ends up being the lowest value. This arrangement reflects the asymmetrical nature of negatively skewed distributions.\n\n2. \n- \"Mean > Median > Mode\": This option is incorrect because, in a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is less than both the median and the mode, not greater.\n- \"Mean = Median = Mode\": This option is wrong because it describes a normal distribution where all three measures of central tendency are equal, which does not occur in a negatively skewed distribution.\n- \"Median > Mean > Mode\": This option is incorrect because it suggests that the median is greater than the mean, which is true, but it incorrectly positions the mode as less than the median, whereas the mode is actually the highest in a negatively skewed distribution.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Bar graph\" because bar graphs are specifically designed to represent nominal and ordinal data by categorizing them into unordered groups. In the case of eye color, each color represents a distinct category, and a bar graph visually depicts the number or percentage of observations for each category, with bars separated by spaces to emphasize the distinctness of each category.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- **Histogram:** A histogram is used for interval and ratio data, where the data is continuous and the bars are not separated, making it inappropriate for nominal data like eye color categories.\n  \n- **Frequency polygon:** Similar to histograms, frequency polygons are also used for interval and ratio data and require continuous data points, which does not apply to nominal categories such as eye color.\n  \n- **Scatterplot:** A scatterplot is used to display the relationship between two continuous variables, making it unsuitable for nominal data, which consists of discrete categories without a meaningful relationship to plot.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"mediator variable\" because it explains the relationship between the independent variable (cognitive-behavioral therapy) and the dependent variable (anxiety reduction). In this context, the change in clients' thinking serves as the mechanism through which therapy leads to reduced anxiety, thus qualifying it as a mediator that clarifies how the independent variable affects the dependent variable.\n\n2. \n- **Moderator variable**: This option is incorrect because a moderator variable influences the strength or direction of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, rather than explaining the process by which the independent variable affects the dependent variable.\n- **Independent variable**: This option is incorrect because the independent variable is the treatment itself (cognitive-behavioral therapy) that is being manipulated, not the change in thinking that occurs as a result of the therapy.\n- **Extraneous variable**: This option is incorrect because extraneous variables are not part of the study's design and do not explain the relationship between the independent and dependent variables; instead, they can complicate the interpretation of the results if they are not controlled.",

      "answer": "Equal intervals between values",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Equal intervals between values,\" is true of interval scales because they assign values to ordered categories with equal differences between adjacent categories, allowing for meaningful comparisons of the magnitude of differences. In contrast, while ratio scales also have equal intervals, they are distinguished by the presence of an absolute zero point, which is not a characteristic of interval scales.\n\n2. The option \"Variables can be ordered\" is incorrect because both interval and ratio scales allow for variables to be ordered; this characteristic applies to both types of scales. The statement \"An absolute zero point\" is incorrect because interval scales do not have an absolute zero point, which is a defining feature of ratio scales. Lastly, the option \"Allowed to perform meaningful ratio comparisons\" is incorrect because meaningful ratio comparisons can only be made with ratio scales due to their absolute zero point, whereas interval scales do not support such comparisons.",

The option \"It explains why the independent variable influences the dependent variable\" is incorrect because this describes a mediator variable, which clarifies the mechanism through which the independent variable impacts the dependent variable. The statement \"It represents an unintended influence on the dependent variable\" is wrong because this describes extraneous variables, which are not part of the study's design but can affect the results.

According to the reference material, a platykurtic distribution is characterized by a flatter shape in the middle and thicker tails than a normal distribution, indicating that scores are more evenly distributed throughout the distribution rather than being concentrated around the mean.\n\n2. The option \"A distribution with a sharp peak and thin tails\" is incorrect because it describes a leptokurtic distribution, which has a sharper peak and thinner tails than a normal distribution. The option \"Symmetrical distribution where mean, median, and mode are equal\" is incorrect as it refers to a normal distribution, not a platykurtic one; platykurtic distributions can still be asymmetrical.

The correct answer, \"It is an unintended variable related to the independent variable affecting the dependent variable,\" accurately describes a confounding variable because it is an extraneous variable that inadvertently influences the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. This means that the confounding variable can obscure the true effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable, making it difficult to determine causation in a research study.\n\n2. The option \"It is a type of mediator variable explaining the relationship between independent and dependent variables\" is incorrect because a mediator variable specifically clarifies how or why an independent variable influences a dependent variable, rather than confounding the relationship. The statement \"It changes the strength or direction of a relationship between variables\" is wrong because this describes a moderator variable, which does influence the relationship but is not necessarily an unintended variable.

Histograms effectively represent interval data by placing scores on the x-axis and the frequency of those scores on the y-axis, with bars that are not separated by spaces, allowing for a clear visualization of the distribution.\n\n2. The **bar graph** is incorrect because it is used for nominal and ordinal data, where categories are unordered or ranked, and does not appropriately depict the continuous nature of interval data like IQ scores. The **boxplot** is also not suitable as it primarily summarizes data through quartiles and does not show the frequency distribution of scores across the entire range.
