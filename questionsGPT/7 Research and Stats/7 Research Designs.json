      "answer": "Grounded Theory",
      "explanation": "1. **Grounded Theory** is the correct answer because its primary goal is to derive a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction that is grounded in the views of the participants in a study. This approach utilizes methods such as interviews and observations to collect data, which are then analyzed to construct the theory based on participants' experiences.\n\n2. **Phenomenology** is incorrect because it focuses on gaining an in-depth understanding of the \"lived experience\" of participants rather than developing a general theory. **Ethnography** is also incorrect because it involves studying participants within their natural culture or setting, emphasizing their engagement in naturally occurring activities rather than theory development. Lastly, **Thematic Analysis** is incorrect as it is a method for identifying and analyzing patterns (themes) within qualitative data, rather than specifically aimed at developing a grounded theory based on participant views.",

      "stem": "In single-subject experimental designs, what is the main methodological advantage of an ABAB reversal design over a simple AB design?",
      "options": [
        "It allows for random assignment of subjects to groups.",
        "It controls for history effects by demonstrating reversibility of behavior change.",
        "It uses multiple subjects simultaneously to improve external validity.",
        "It eliminates the need for a baseline phase."
      ],
      "answer": "It controls for history effects by demonstrating reversibility of behavior change.",
      "explanation": "In single-subject experimental designs, the ABAB reversal design is advantageous because it includes multiple phases that allow researchers to observe changes in behavior across different conditions. This design demonstrates reversibility; if a behavior returns to baseline levels when the treatment is withdrawn (during the second baseline phase), it indicates that the observed changes were likely due to the treatment rather than external historical events that could have influenced the results. Thus, it effectively controls for history effects.\n\nNow, let’s examine why the incorrect options are not valid:\n\n- **It allows for random assignment of subjects to groups.** This statement is incorrect because single-subject designs, including ABAB designs, do not involve random assignment; they focus on repeated measures of the same individual or individuals treated as a single group.\n\n- **It uses multiple subjects simultaneously to improve external validity.** This is incorrect as well; while multiple subjects can be included in single-subject designs, the primary focus of an ABAB design is on changes within the same subject, not on improving external validity through simultaneous group comparisons.\n\n- **It eliminates the need for a baseline phase.** This option is also wrong because both AB and ABAB designs require a baseline phase to establish a reference point for measuring the effects of the treatment. The ABAB design actually emphasizes the importance of having at least two baseline phases to assess the impact of the treatment more effectively. \n\nIn summary, the ABAB design's ability to demonstrate reversibility of behavior change is its main advantage over the simpler AB design, while the incorrect options misrepresent the characteristics and methodologies of single-subject experimental designs.",

      "answer": "Between-subjects design",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Between-subjects design\" because this research design involves randomly assigning different participants to each group receiving a different level of the independent variable—in this case, the low, moderate, and high doses of an antidepressant. This method allows the researcher to compare the effects of the varying doses on depressive symptoms while ensuring that each participant is only exposed to one level of the independent variable, thus minimizing potential confounding variables.\n\n2. \n- **Within-subjects design**: This option is incorrect because a within-subjects design would require each participant to be exposed to multiple levels of the independent variable (e.g., all doses), rather than assigning different participants to different dose groups.\n  \n- **Mixed design**: This option is incorrect because a mixed design involves at least one between-subjects variable and one within-subjects variable, which is not the case here as all participants are only assigned to one dose level.\n\n- **Multiple baseline design**: This option is incorrect because a multiple baseline design involves sequentially applying the independent variable across different behaviors, tasks, settings, or subjects, rather than comparing different groups receiving different levels of a treatment simultaneously.",

      ],
      "answer": "It eliminates the need to withdraw the treatment once applied to a behavior.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"It eliminates the need to withdraw the treatment once applied to a behavior,\" highlights a key advantage of the multiple baseline design over a reversal design. In a multiple baseline design, the independent variable is sequentially applied across different behaviors without the need to remove the treatment once it has been implemented, allowing researchers to assess the effectiveness of the treatment without the ethical or practical concerns associated with withdrawing treatment from participants. This approach helps ensure that the effects observed are due to the treatment rather than external factors or the withdrawal of treatment.\n\n2. The option \"It requires fewer baseline phases to establish stable behavior\" is incorrect because multiple baseline designs typically involve multiple baseline phases to assess different behaviors, making them potentially more complex than reversal designs, which may require fewer phases. The statement \"It randomly assigns participants to treatment conditions\" is wrong because multiple baseline designs do not involve random assignment; they focus on the sequential application of treatment across behaviors, tasks, or subjects. Lastly, \"It produces the highest external validity among single-subject designs\" is incorrect because while multiple baseline designs can offer good internal validity, they do not inherently guarantee higher external validity compared to other designs, such as group designs or well-implemented single-subject studies.",

This design allows researchers to compare the scores of various age groups simultaneously, making it distinct from other designs that measure changes over time.\n\n2. **Longitudinal research** is incorrect because it involves repeated assessments of the same group of individuals over an extended period, rather than measuring different age groups at one point in time. **Cross-sequential research** is also incorrect as it combines elements of both longitudinal and cross-sectional designs, involving repeated measures of the same individuals at different ages over time. **Experimental research** is not applicable here because it typically evaluates causal relationships through manipulation of independent variables, rather than simply measuring cognitive functioning across different age groups at a single time point.",

The correct answer, \"To collaborate with community partners to generate knowledge and promote social change,\" accurately reflects the primary goal of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). CBPR emphasizes equitable partnerships between researchers and community members, recognizing their unique strengths and fostering collaboration throughout the research process to address issues of importance to the community and achieve social change (Kellogg Community Health Scholars Program, 2001).\n\n2. The option \"To test hypotheses in a controlled laboratory environment\" is incorrect because CBPR is not limited to laboratory settings; it aims to engage with communities in real-world contexts to address relevant social issues. The statement \"To develop abstract theories based solely on academic researchers’ perspectives\" is wrong as CBPR prioritizes community input and perspectives rather than relying solely on those of academic researchers.

      "answer": "Predict an individual's exam score based on their hours studied.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Predict an individual's exam score based on their hours studied,\" is accurate because a regression equation derived from correlational analysis allows researchers to use the relationship between the predictor variable (hours studied) and the criterion variable (exam score) to make predictions about individual outcomes. In this context, the regression equation provides a formula that estimates the expected exam score for a given number of hours studied, demonstrating the predictive utility of the correlation.\n\n2. The option \"Establish a causal relationship between hours studied and exam score\" is incorrect because correlational studies do not manipulate variables or control for confounding factors, meaning they cannot confirm causation. \"Describe the characteristics of the sample using descriptive statistics\" is wrong because while descriptive statistics summarize data, they do not utilize the regression equation to make predictions about individual scores. Lastly, \"Determine the population mean exam score\" is incorrect as the regression equation focuses on individual predictions rather than calculating the mean for the entire population, which would require different statistical approaches.",

The correct answer, \"Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and controlled study conditions,\" highlights a major limitation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that affects generalizability. While RCTs are considered the gold standard in clinical research due to their ability to establish causal relationships through random assignment, the stringent criteria for participant selection and the highly controlled environments can limit the applicability of the findings to broader, more diverse populations and real-world settings.\n\n2. The option \"Use of random assignment to groups\" is incorrect because random assignment is a strength of RCTs that enhances internal validity by ensuring that groups are equivalent at the study's outset. The option \"Lack of a control group\" is incorrect because RCTs typically include a control group, which is essential for comparing treatment effects.

Thematic analysis is defined as a method for recognizing and reporting patterns (themes) within qualitative data, which is essential for interpreting and summarizing the information gathered from in-depth interviews and focus groups.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"To test specific hypotheses using numerical data,\" is wrong because thematic analysis does not involve hypothesis testing or quantitative data; it focuses on qualitative data interpretation. The second incorrect option, \"To develop large-scale statistical models of behavior,\" is incorrect as thematic analysis is not concerned with statistical modeling but rather with identifying themes in qualitative research.

      "answer": "Within-subjects variable",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Within-subjects variable,\" is accurate because, in this mixed research design, each participant is assessed on depressive symptoms multiple times over the course of the study, specifically measuring their symptoms weekly after being assigned to different drug doses. This means that each participant serves as their own control across the different time points, which is characteristic of a within-subjects design.\n\n2. The option \"Between-subjects variable\" is incorrect because, in a between-subjects design, different groups of participants would receive different levels of the independent variable, but here, the same participants are measured over time. \"Confounding variable\" is not applicable in this context, as it refers to an extraneous factor that may affect the dependent variable, but the question specifically addresses the manipulation and measurement of the independent variable.

      "answer": "Grounded Theory",
      "explanation": "1. **Grounded Theory** is the correct answer because it specifically aims to derive a general, abstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the views of participants. This method relies heavily on data collected through interviews and observations, employing iterative coding processes to develop theories directly from the data rather than testing pre-existing theories.\n\n2. **Ethnography** is incorrect because it focuses on studying participants within their natural culture or setting, emphasizing the context of behaviors rather than theory development. **Case Study** is also incorrect as it involves in-depth information collection about a particular individual, group, or situation, but does not primarily aim to generate theories through iterative coding. Lastly, **Content Analysis** is incorrect because it is a method used to analyze textual or visual data to identify patterns or themes, rather than developing theories based on participant data through coding processes.",
