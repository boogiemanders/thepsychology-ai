      "answer": "Lack of seeking or responding to comfort when distressed",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Lack of seeking or responding to comfort when distressed,\" is specific to Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) because it reflects the core symptoms of the disorder, which include a persistent pattern of inhibited and emotionally withdrawn behavior toward adult caregivers. This behavior is characterized by a lack of comfort-seeking or responsiveness when the child is in distress, indicating a significant impairment in emotional attachment and social functioning.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"A persistent pattern of overly familiar behavior with strangers,\" is associated with Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder, not RAD, as it describes inappropriate interactions with unfamiliar adults rather than withdrawal from caregivers. The second incorrect option, \"Recurrent distressing memories of a traumatic event,\" is a key symptom of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and does not pertain to RAD, which focuses on attachment issues rather than trauma-related memories. Lastly, \"Preoccupation with thoughts about a deceased person\" is a symptom of Prolonged Grief Disorder, which involves intense yearning and preoccupation following the death of a close person, making it unrelated to the attachment issues seen in RAD.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Reduced reticence in approaching unfamiliar adults and willingness to leave with them,\" is characteristic of Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED) because this disorder involves a persistent pattern of behavior marked by inappropriate interactions with unfamiliar adults. Individuals with DSED display diminished caution in approaching strangers and may exhibit overly familiar behavior, which aligns with the behaviors described in the correct answer.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Avoidance of strangers and excessive clinginess to caregivers,\" is wrong because it describes behaviors associated with Reactive Attachment Disorder rather than DSED, which involves engaging with strangers. The second incorrect option, \"Persistent social withdrawal and minimized emotional responsiveness,\" is incorrect as it also reflects symptoms of Reactive Attachment Disorder, where there is emotional withdrawal rather than disinhibition. The third incorrect option, \"Excessive worry about a serious illness despite minimal symptoms,\" is not relevant to DSED as it pertains to Illness Anxiety Disorder, which focuses on health-related anxieties rather than social engagement behaviors.",

      "answer": "Reduced volume of the hippocampus and hyperactive amygdala",
      "explanation": "1. \"Reduced volume of the hippocampus and hyperactive amygdala\" is the correct answer because neuroimaging studies have consistently linked PTSD to these specific brain abnormalities. The hyperactive amygdala is associated with an exaggerated fear response, while the reduced volume of the hippocampus is thought to relate to difficulties in memory processing and emotional regulation, both of which are prevalent in individuals with PTSD.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Hyperactivity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and reduced amygdala activity,\" is wrong because PTSD is characterized by reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which normally inhibits the amygdala, rather than hyperactivity. The second option, \"Increased serotonin levels and decreased dopamine activity,\" is incorrect because PTSD is associated with decreased serotonin and GABA activity, not increased serotonin, along with increased levels and activity of dopamine and norepinephrine. Lastly, \"Hypoactive anterior cingulate cortex with increased GABA activity\" is wrong because, while there is evidence of hypoactivity in the anterior cingulate cortex in PTSD, the disorder is linked to decreased GABA activity, not increased.",

      "answer": "Factitious disorder involves deception without obvious external incentives, whereas malingering involves external incentives",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Factitious disorder involves deception without obvious external incentives, whereas malingering involves external incentives,\" accurately captures the core distinction between these two conditions. Factitious disorder is characterized by individuals intentionally falsifying or inducing symptoms without any clear external gain, motivated instead by a psychological need to be seen as ill. In contrast, malingering is driven by the pursuit of tangible benefits, such as financial compensation or drugs, indicating that the deceptive behavior is motivated by external rewards.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Factitious disorder involves intentional symptom fabrication for external rewards, while malingering does not,\" is wrong because it inaccurately suggests that factitious disorder is motivated by external rewards, which contradicts its definition. The second option, \"Malingering always occurs in a healthcare setting, whereas factitious disorder occurs outside of it,\" is incorrect because both conditions can manifest in healthcare settings; the key difference lies in the motivation behind the symptoms, not the context. Lastly, the statement \"Individuals with malingering lack insight into their deceptive behavior\" is incorrect because individuals who engage in malingering are typically aware of their actions and the reasons for them, while those with factitious disorder may not fully recognize their motivations or the nature of their deception.",

      "answer": "Hazy and gradual onset and partial memory retention for events during amnestic period",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Hazy and gradual onset and partial memory retention for events during amnestic period,\" aligns with the characteristics of dissociative amnesia. Individuals with dissociative amnesia typically experience an inability to recall important personal information, and their memory loss often has a gradual onset, with some retention of memories from the amnestic period. This contrasts with feigned memory loss, where the individual usually presents a sudden and complete loss of memory.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Sudden onset and termination of amnestic period with complete memory loss,\" is wrong because individuals with dissociative amnesia generally do not exhibit a sudden and complete memory loss; instead, their memory loss develops more gradually. The second incorrect option, \"Complete and permanent memory loss beginning abruptly with no recollection of events,\" is incorrect as dissociative amnesia does not typically result in permanent memory loss, and the onset is not abrupt. Lastly, the option \"Belief that memory loss is entirely irreversible and unrelated to trauma\" is incorrect because individuals with dissociative amnesia often have a recognition that their memory loss is related to trauma, rather than viewing it as entirely irreversible.",

      "answer": "Presence of one or more distressing somatic symptoms",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Presence of one or more distressing somatic symptoms,\" is accurate because, according to the DSM-5-TR, Illness Anxiety Disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness despite the presence of no or only mild somatic symptoms. This means that distressing somatic symptoms are not a requirement for the diagnosis, distinguishing it from other somatic symptom disorders where such symptoms are central.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness,\" is wrong because this preoccupation is a fundamental feature of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The second incorrect option, \"Excessive anxiety about health status,\" is incorrect as excessive anxiety regarding health is also a core characteristic of the disorder.

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Symptoms involve voluntary motor or sensory dysfunction incompatible with recognized medical conditions and cause significant distress,\" accurately describes Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder) as it specifically highlights the nature of symptoms that manifest as disturbances in voluntary motor or sensory functions. These symptoms are not attributable to any known neurological or medical conditions, and they result in significant distress or impairment in functioning, aligning with the diagnostic criteria outlined in the reference material.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Symptoms mimic known neurological or medical conditions but are intentionally produced for external gain,\" is wrong because it describes malingering rather than Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder, which does not involve intentional symptom production for external rewards. The second incorrect option, \"Symptoms arise as part of a psychotic disorder and involve delusions related to paralysis,\" is incorrect because Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder does not involve psychotic features or delusions; rather, it focuses on non-psychotic symptoms of motor or sensory dysfunction.

Individuals with a history of psychiatric disorders may have pre-existing vulnerabilities that can exacerbate their response to traumatic events, making them more susceptible to PTSD symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2022).\n\n2. The option \"High socioeconomic status\" is incorrect because lower socioeconomic status is associated with a greater risk of developing PTSD, not higher status. \"Extensive social support\" is also incorrect, as having strong social support typically serves as a protective factor against PTSD rather than a risk factor.

      ],
      "answer": "Death of someone close at least 12 months ago",
      "explanation": "1. \"Death of someone close at least 12 months ago\" is the correct answer because, according to the diagnostic criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder in adults, the death must have occurred at least 12 months prior to the diagnosis. This criterion is essential to differentiate prolonged grief from normal grief responses, which typically diminish over time, whereas prolonged grief persists and is characterized by intense yearning or preoccupation with the deceased.\n\n2. The option \"Bereavement due to a traumatic or violent death\" is incorrect because the diagnostic criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder do not specify the nature of the death (e.g., traumatic or violent) as a requirement for diagnosis. \"Preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased for at least six months\" is incorrect because the criteria require this preoccupation to occur nearly every day for at least the previous month, not a minimum duration of six months.

      "answer": "Reduced inhibitory control of the amygdala by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex leads to exaggerated fear responses",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Reduced inhibitory control of the amygdala by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex leads to exaggerated fear responses,\" is supported by research indicating that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex normally inhibits amygdala activity. In PTSD, decreased activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex diminishes this inhibitory control, resulting in heightened fear responses and contributing to the persistence of PTSD symptoms.\n\n2. The option \"The hyperactivity of the hippocampus alone accounts for symptom persistence\" is incorrect because while there are findings of both increased and decreased hippocampal activity in PTSD, it is not solely responsible for symptom persistence; rather, the interplay of various brain regions is involved. The statement \"Increased anterior cingulate cortex activity causes persistent avoidance symptoms\" is wrong as the anterior cingulate cortex is linked to emotional regulation and decision-making, but its activity alone does not directly cause avoidance symptoms in PTSD. Lastly, the option \"High serotonin levels intensify re-experiencing symptoms through increased neural excitation\" is misleading because PTSD is associated with decreased serotonin levels, not high levels, which are linked to alleviating symptoms, rather than exacerbating them.",

      ],
      "answer": "Excessive familiarity with strangers",
      "explanation": "1. \"Excessive familiarity with strangers\" is the correct answer because it is one of the defining symptoms of Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSED). This disorder is characterized by inappropriate interactions with unfamiliar adults, including behaviors such as reduced reticence in approaching or interacting with strangers and overly familiar behavior, which clearly aligns with the symptom of excessive familiarity.\n\n2. The option \"Inability to form emotional attachments\" is incorrect because DSED involves a lack of appropriate social boundaries rather than an inability to form attachments; children may engage with strangers inappropriately without forming deep emotional connections. \"Persistent sadness and withdrawal\" is incorrect as these symptoms are more characteristic of Reactive Attachment Disorder, which involves emotional withdrawal from caregivers rather than inappropriate engagement with strangers. Lastly, \"Recurrent nightmares about separation\" is incorrect because this symptom is more indicative of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders, not DSED, which focuses on behavior towards unfamiliar adults rather than nightmares or separation anxiety.",

      ],
      "answer": "Re-experiencing traumatic events",
      "explanation": "1. \"Re-experiencing traumatic events\" is the correct answer because it is a hallmark symptom of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), where individuals relive or have distressing memories of the traumatic event. This symptom is not present in Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which focuses more on emotional withdrawal and disturbances in relationships rather than intrusive memories of trauma.\n\n2. \n- **Emotional dysregulation**: While emotional dysregulation can occur in both PTSD and RAD, it is not a defining feature of PTSD and is more prominently associated with RAD's persistent social and emotional disturbances.\n- **Inhibited social engagement**: This behavior is specific to Reactive Attachment Disorder, where individuals show a lack of seeking comfort from caregivers, contrasting with the re-experiencing symptoms typical of PTSD.\n- **Lack of emotional expression**: Although individuals with RAD may exhibit a lack of emotional expression, PTSD is characterized more by intrusive memories and heightened arousal rather than an absence of emotional expression.",
