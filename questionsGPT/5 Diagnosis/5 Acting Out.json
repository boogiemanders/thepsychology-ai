      "answer": "Persistent pattern of stealing or deceitfulness",
      "explanation": "1. \"Persistent pattern of stealing or deceitfulness\" is the correct answer because this symptom is associated with conduct disorder (CD), not oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). ODD is characterized by a recurrent pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness, which does not include stealing or deceitfulness as part of its diagnostic criteria.\n\n2. The option \"Deliberately annoys others\" is incorrect because it is one of the characteristic symptoms of ODD, indicating a defiant behavior towards others. \"Often blames others for their mistakes\" is also incorrect, as this symptom reflects a common behavior seen in individuals with ODD, demonstrating a lack of responsibility for their actions. Lastly, \"Is angry and resentful\" is incorrect because it is a key symptom of ODD, highlighting the individual's emotional state that aligns with the disorder's diagnostic criteria.",

The \"Childhood-onset type\" of conduct disorder (CD) is associated with a higher risk of developing antisocial personality disorder in adulthood because it involves at least one symptom occurring before age 10, leading to a pattern of increasingly serious antisocial behaviors that persist into adulthood. This subtype is linked to neuropsychological deficits and adverse child-rearing environments, which contribute to a greater likelihood of long-term negative outcomes, including criminal behavior and substance-related disorders.\n\n2. \n- **Adolescent-onset type**: This subtype does not have symptoms before age 10 and is typically associated with a temporary pattern of antisocial behavior, which is less likely to lead to antisocial personality disorder in adulthood.\n- **Unspecified onset type**: This category does not provide specific information about the timing of symptom onset, making it impossible to determine the associated risks for antisocial personality disorder.\n- **Late adolescent-onset type**: Similar to the adolescent-onset type, this variant occurs after age 10 and is characterized by behaviors that are often situational and less likely to result in long-term antisocial personality disorder.",

      "answer": "Adolescence-limited type",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Adolescence-limited type\" is the correct answer because it represents a temporary and situational pattern of antisocial behavior that arises due to a \"maturity gap\" between an adolescent's biological and social maturity. This type of behavior is not consistent across situations and typically resolves as the individual matures, distinguishing it from more chronic forms of antisocial behavior.\n\n2. The \"Life-course-persistent type\" is incorrect because it refers to a pattern of increasingly serious antisocial behaviors that begins in early childhood and continues into adulthood, indicating a stable trajectory rather than a temporary one. The \"Childhood-onset type\" is also incorrect as it involves symptoms appearing before age 10 and is associated with a higher degree of aggressiveness and a greater likelihood of ongoing antisocial behavior into adulthood.

      "answer": "Lower physiological reactions to aversive stimuli",
      "explanation": "1. \"Lower physiological reactions to aversive stimuli\" is the correct answer because research has shown that children with conduct disorder (CD) exhibit reduced physiological responses, such as lower heart rate and skin conductance, when exposed to stressful situations. Studies indicate that compared to healthy children, those with CD do not experience the typical increase in physiological arousal in response to aversive stimuli, suggesting a discrepancy between their emotional and physiological reactions.\n\n2. The option \"Elevated resting heart rate compared to healthy peers\" is incorrect because children with conduct disorder typically have a lower resting heart rate, which is associated with their reduced physiological reactivity. \"Heightened skin conductance responses\" is wrong because evidence indicates that children with CD have lower skin conductance responses, not heightened ones, in stressful situations. Lastly, \"Increased cardiovascular reactivity during stress\" is incorrect as children with CD do not show the expected increase in cardiovascular responses, further highlighting their atypical physiological functioning in response to stressors.",

      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Verbal or physical aggression occurs on average twice weekly for at least three months without causing injury or property damage\" is correct because it aligns with the diagnostic criteria for intermittent explosive disorder (IED). According to the reference material, IED is characterized by recurrent behavioral outbursts due to a failure to control aggressive impulses, which can manifest as verbal or physical aggression occurring at least twice weekly for a minimum of three months. Importantly, these outbursts do not result in damage or destruction to property or physical injury to others.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- \"IED involves premeditated aggressive acts aimed at achieving tangible outcomes\": This is incorrect because IED requires that outbursts are not premeditated and are not committed with the intention of achieving a tangible outcome.\n- \"Aggressive outbursts in IED are proportional to the provocation or social stressor\": This statement is false because the level of aggressiveness in IED must not be proportional to the provocation or any precipitating social stressor, indicating a disproportionate response.\n- \"The disorder can be diagnosed in children younger than six years old\": This is incorrect as the diagnosis of IED requires that the individual be at least six years old or at the equivalent developmental level, thus excluding younger children.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"It helps children identify others\u2019 feelings and develop prosocial conflict resolution skills,\" accurately characterizes Problem-Solving Skills Training (PSST) because PSST focuses on the cognitive processes underlying problematic behaviors in children with conduct disorder. This intervention teaches children to accurately perceive the feelings of others, understand the consequences of their actions, and identify positive ways to resolve interpersonal conflicts, which are essential for improving their social interactions and reducing disruptive behaviors.\n\n2. The option \"It emphasizes operant conditioning techniques to modify externalizing behavior\" is incorrect because this description aligns more closely with Parent Management Training (PMT), which uses operant conditioning principles to change parenting approaches and child behavior. The statement \"It focuses on altering power structures within family systems\" is wrong as it pertains to Functional Family Therapy (FFT), which addresses family dynamics rather than individual skill development.

      "answer": "Parental history of criminology and substance abuse",
      "explanation": "1. \"Parental history of criminology and substance abuse\" is the correct answer because research has linked an increased risk for conduct disorder (CD) to adverse family experiences, including parental criminality and substance abuse. Family studies indicate that these factors contribute significantly to the likelihood of developing CD, emphasizing the role of the family environment in the disorder's etiology.\n\n2. The option \"High concordance rates in dizygotic twins compared to monozygotic twins\" is incorrect because studies show that monozygotic twins have higher concordance rates than dizygotic twins, indicating a stronger genetic influence in conduct disorder. \"Increased physiological reactions to aversive stimuli\" is wrong because children with conduct disorder typically exhibit lower physiological reactions to stress, not increased reactions, as evidenced by research measuring heart rate and cortisol levels. Lastly, \"Consistent positive parenting and supervision\" is not a risk factor; rather, it is the absence of positive parenting and the presence of coercive interactions that increase the risk for conduct disorder.",

Studies have shown that participation in these programs tends to increase the likelihood that juvenile offenders and at-risk juveniles will engage in criminal behaviors in the future, contradicting the intended purpose of these interventions.\n\n2. The option \"Are effective in reducing future criminal behaviors\" is incorrect because research consistently shows that these programs do not achieve their goal of reducing criminal behavior; rather, they have the opposite effect. The option \"Have no significant impact compared to no intervention\" is wrong because the evidence suggests that these programs actually lead to negative outcomes, rather than having a neutral effect.

      "explanation": "1. **Correct Answer Explanation:** \"Moffitt\u2019s developmental taxonomy distinguishing neuropsychological deficits and social maturity gaps\" is the correct answer because it specifically outlines the different underlying causes for life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited types of conduct disorder. Moffitt posits that the life-course-persistent type is associated with neuropsychological deficits that lead to a consistent pattern of antisocial behavior starting in early childhood, whereas the adolescence-limited type arises from a maturity gap between biological and social maturity, resulting in temporary antisocial behaviors during adolescence.\n\n2. **Incorrect Options Explanation:**\n   - **Biosocial theory focusing on gene-environment interactions:** This theory addresses the interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors but does not specifically differentiate the developmental pathways of the two types of conduct disorder as Moffitt\u2019s taxonomy does.\n   - **Social learning theory emphasizing modeling and reinforcement:** While this theory explains behavior acquisition through observation and reinforcement, it does not account for the neuropsychological aspects and the distinct developmental trajectories proposed by Moffitt.\n   - **Attachment theory focusing on early caregiver relationships:** This theory highlights the importance of early relationships in emotional and social development but does not specifically address the neuropsychological deficits or the maturity gap that characterize the life-course-persistent and adolescence-limited types of conduct disorder.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Availability heuristic may cause overestimation of CD when recent cases are vivid to the assessor,\" reflects how cognitive biases can influence clinical judgment. When assessors are recently exposed to vivid cases of conduct disorder (CD), they may overestimate its prevalence in their evaluations due to the ease with which these examples come to mind, leading to a skewed interpretation of assessment data. This can result in an inflated perception of the disorder's occurrence in the population, affecting diagnosis and treatment decisions.\n\n2. The option \"Ignoring base rates leads to accurate interpretation of clinical symptoms\" is incorrect because disregarding base rates can often lead to misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis, as clinicians may not accurately contextualize symptoms within the larger population. The statement \"High prevalence of CD in a population decreases false alarms in diagnosis\" is misleading; a high prevalence could actually increase the likelihood of false positives if assessors do not consider base rates properly, as they may assume that symptoms are more indicative of CD than they are.

        "Engaging in physical fights",

      ],
      "answer": "Engaging in physical fights",
      "explanation": "1. \"Engaging in physical fights\" is indicative of conduct disorder (CD) because it falls under the category of aggression towards people, which is a characteristic symptom required for a CD diagnosis. Conduct disorder is defined by a persistent pattern of behavior that violates the rights of others or social norms, and physical aggression is a clear violation of these rights. In contrast, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) primarily involves angry/irritable moods and argumentative behaviors without the severe aggression that characterizes CD.\n\n2. \n- **Often loses temper:** This symptom is associated with oppositional defiant disorder, where individuals frequently exhibit irritability and anger but do not necessarily engage in aggressive behaviors that violate others' rights.\n- **Argues actively with adults:** This behavior is characteristic of ODD, indicating a defiant attitude towards authority figures, rather than the more severe and aggressive behaviors seen in conduct disorder.\n- **Has a negative attitude towards authority:** This symptom reflects the defiant and oppositional nature of ODD, which involves challenging authority without the significant aggression or rule-breaking behaviors required for a diagnosis of conduct disorder.",
