      ],
      "answer": "Deficits in intellectual functioning determined by standardized intelligence testing",
      "explanation": "1. \"Deficits in intellectual functioning determined by standardized intelligence testing\" is the correct answer because the DSM-5-TR specifies that a diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder requires clear evidence of intellectual deficits, which must be assessed using individualized and standardized intelligence testing. This criterion is essential for confirming the cognitive impairments that characterize the disorder.\n\n2. The option \"Presence of stereotyped or repetitive motor movements\" is incorrect because this symptom is associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), not Intellectual Developmental Disorder. \"Symptoms beginning after school entry\" is wrong because the DSM-5-TR states that deficits must onset during the developmental period, which is before the child starts school. Lastly, \"Deficits solely in academic achievement\" is incorrect as the diagnosis requires deficits in intellectual functioning and adaptive functioning, not just academic skills, to meet the criteria for Intellectual Developmental Disorder.",

      "answer": "Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome",
      "explanation": "1. \"Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome\" is the correct answer because these two genetic causes are identified as the most common contributors to Intellectual Disability when the etiology is known. Specifically, Down syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality resulting from an error during cell division, while Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited genetic disorder, caused by a mutated gene on the X chromosome. Together, they account for a significant proportion of cases with known genetic etiology.\n\n2. The option \"Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome\" is incorrect because, while Fragile X syndrome is a common genetic cause of Intellectual Disability, Turner syndrome is not typically associated with Intellectual Disability to the same extent and primarily affects females with a missing or incomplete X chromosome. The option \"Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome\" is wrong because, although both are genetic disorders that can involve intellectual impairment, they are not among the most common causes of Intellectual Disability specifically listed in the reference material. Lastly, \"Williams syndrome and Down syndrome\" is incorrect because, while Down syndrome is correctly included, Williams syndrome is less common and not noted as a primary contributor to Intellectual Disability compared to Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome.",

      "answer": "Intellectual disability",
      "explanation": "1. \"Intellectual disability\" is the correct answer because it is not a required symptom domain for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The diagnosis of ASD specifically requires deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restrictive and repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities, but it does not necessitate the presence of intellectual disability, as individuals with ASD can have a range of intellectual functioning.\n\n2. The option \"Deficits in social communication and interaction\" is incorrect because this is a core requirement for an ASD diagnosis, emphasizing the need for impairments in social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and the ability to develop and maintain relationships. \"Restrictive and repetitive behaviors, interests, and activities\" is also incorrect, as this symptom domain is essential for the diagnosis, including behaviors such as stereotyped movements and insistence on sameness. Lastly, \"Early onset during the developmental period\" is incorrect because the onset of symptoms during early development is a crucial criterion for diagnosing ASD, ensuring that symptoms appear before the child starts school.",

      ],
      "answer": "Accelerated brain growth beginning at about 6 months of age",
      "explanation": "1. \"Accelerated brain growth beginning at about 6 months of age\" is the correct answer because studies have found that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) exhibit this characteristic growth pattern, which is associated with larger-than-normal head circumference and increased brain volume and weight during early development. This abnormality in brain growth is a key neuroanatomical feature linked to ASD, indicating atypical brain development during a critical period.\n\n2. The option \"Reduced volume of the prefrontal cortex\" is incorrect because, while children with ADHD have been found to have reduced volumes in this area, the reference material does not specifically link this abnormality to ASD. \"Enlarged hippocampus\" is incorrect as the material does not mention the hippocampus as a common neuroanatomical abnormality associated with ASD. Lastly, \"Increased serotonin levels throughout the brain\" is wrong because individuals with ASD often have lower-than-normal levels of serotonin in several brain areas, contradicting the claim of increased levels.",

      ],
      "answer": "Low dopamine and norepinephrine levels",
      "explanation": "1. \"Low dopamine and norepinephrine levels\" is the correct answer because research has consistently identified these neurotransmitter deficiencies as contributors to the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of ADHD. Specifically, low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex are linked to impairments in impulse control, attention, and executive functioning, which are core features of ADHD.\n\n2. The option \"Excess serotonin and elevated GABA\" is incorrect because ADHD has not been linked to high levels of serotonin or GABA; rather, individuals with ADHD often show low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Similarly, \"Elevated acetylcholine and glutamate\" is wrong because while glutamate may play a role in various brain functions, there is no strong evidence to suggest that elevated acetylcholine or glutamate is associated with ADHD symptoms. Lastly, \"Low serotonin and increased dopamine\" is incorrect because ADHD is characterized by low levels of dopamine, not increased levels, and serotonin is not identified as a primary neurotransmitter involved in the disorder's symptoms.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Parent- and teacher-administered behavioral interventions as first-line treatment,\" is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines, which recommend these interventions for preschool children with ADHD as the primary approach. These behavioral strategies, such as parent training in behavioral management, are tailored to improve the child's behavior effectively before considering medication.\n\n2. The option \"Medication alone without behavioral interventions\" is incorrect because the guidelines emphasize that medication should only be prescribed when behavioral interventions do not lead to adequate improvement. \"Combined medication and behavioral interventions immediately\" is wrong because the guidelines suggest starting with behavioral interventions first, rather than jumping to a combination treatment. Lastly, \"No treatment until school entry\" is incorrect as the guidelines advocate for early intervention, highlighting that preschool children should receive behavioral support rather than delaying treatment until they enter school.",

      "answer": "At least one vocal tic and multiple motor tics present for more than one year before age 18",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"At least one vocal tic and multiple motor tics present for more than one year before age 18,\" accurately reflects the diagnostic criteria for Tourette\u2019s disorder as defined by the DSM-5-TR. This disorder specifically requires the presence of both vocal and multiple motor tics that have persisted for more than one year and have an onset before the age of 18, distinguishing it from other tic disorders.\n\n2. The option \"Multiple vocal tics that persist for less than one year\" is incorrect because Tourette\u2019s disorder requires both vocal and motor tics to be present for more than one year, not just vocal tics. The option \"Either motor or vocal tics lasting less than one year\" is wrong because it does not meet the criteria of having both types of tics for a duration longer than one year. Lastly, \"One or more motor tics only lasting more than one year\" is incorrect because it fails to include the necessary vocal tics, which are essential for a diagnosis of Tourette\u2019s disorder.",

      "answer": "There is no significant difference in future substance use problems between treated and untreated ADHD children",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"There is no significant difference in future substance use problems between treated and untreated ADHD children,\" is supported by a meta-analysis conducted by Humphreys, Eng, and Lee (2013), which found that children with ADHD who received psychostimulant treatment did not have a different rate of substance-related problems compared to those who did not receive treatment. This indicates that treatment with psychostimulants does not increase or decrease the risk for later substance use disorders, challenging the misconception that such treatment may lead to substance abuse.\n\n2. The statement \"Psychostimulant treatment increases the risk of substance-related problems in adulthood\" is incorrect because research shows no significant difference in substance use issues between treated and untreated ADHD children, indicating that treatment does not elevate risk. The option \"Psychostimulant treatment prevents later substance use disorders\" is also misleading, as the studies do not support that treatment guarantees prevention of substance use problems; they simply show no increased risk. Lastly, the claim \"Psychostimulant treatment causes immediate substance abuse during adolescence\" is false because the research indicates that treatment does not lead to increased rates of substance use, neither immediately nor in the long term.",

      "explanation": "1. \"Use of atypical facial grimaces in speech\" is the correct answer because it is not listed as one of the symptoms associated with Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (stuttering). The reference material identifies specific symptoms of stuttering, such as sound and syllable repetitions and blocking, but does not mention atypical facial grimaces as a characteristic feature of this disorder.\n\n2. \n- **Sound and syllable repetitions:** This is a typical symptom of Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder, where individuals may repeat sounds or syllables as part of their speech difficulties.\n- **Audible or silent blocking:** This symptom refers to the interruption of speech flow, which can be audible (a pause) or silent (a moment of inability to speak), and is recognized as a common characteristic of stuttering.\n- **Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions:** This symptom involves repeating entire words, such as saying \"I-I-I want\" instead of \"I want,\" and is also a recognized feature of Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder.",

      "answer": "Two times more common in males than females; most prevalent diagnosis among 3- to 17-year-olds",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Two times more common in males than females; most prevalent diagnosis among 3- to 17-year-olds,\" accurately reflects the findings that ADHD is diagnosed twice as often in males during childhood, with a prevalence rate identified as the highest among youth aged 3 to 17 years. Specifically, surveys indicate that ADHD is the most prevalent diagnosed disorder in this age group, confirming its significant impact on this population.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Equal prevalence between males and females; 5% of children diagnosed,\" is wrong because ADHD is not equally prevalent; it is actually two times more common in males, and the prevalence is higher than 5% among diagnosed children. The second option, \"More prevalent in females; under 1% of children diagnosed,\" is incorrect because ADHD is more prevalent in males, and the diagnosed prevalence in children is approximately 3.2%, not under 1%. Lastly, the fourth option, \"Four times more common in females; rare diagnosis in childhood,\" is false as it misrepresents the gender ratio and the prevalence, which shows ADHD is diagnosed three times more often in males, not females, and is not considered rare in childhood.",

      "explanation": "1. The statement \"Heritability of ASD averages about 62% with additional environmental risk factors also involved\" is correct because research indicates a significant genetic contribution to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with heritability estimates around 62%.

      "answer": "Bayesian Probability Theory",
      "explanation": "1. **Bayesian Probability Theory** is the correct answer because it emphasizes the role of prior knowledge (base rates) and evidence in updating beliefs about the likelihood of a particular outcome. In the context of interpreting neuropsychological test results, Bayesian approaches allow clinicians to consider the prevalence of conditions (base rates) and adjust their interpretations of test scores accordingly, thus minimizing biases that may arise from overestimating or underestimating the significance of test results in individual cases.\n\n2. **Signal Detection Theory** is incorrect because it focuses on the ability to distinguish between signal (true positives) and noise (false positives) in decision-making, rather than incorporating base rates into the interpretation of test results. **Classical Test Theory** is also not applicable, as it primarily deals with the reliability and validity of test scores without addressing the influence of base rates or biases in interpretation.

      "answer": "Base rate neglect",
      "explanation": "1. **Base rate neglect** is the correct answer because it refers to the tendency to ignore the general prevalence (or base rate) of a disorder when evaluating specific cases.

The option \"Presence of social communication deficits\" is incorrect because it pertains specifically to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), not specific learning disorders. The option \"Onset of symptoms after the age of 18\" is wrong because the DSM-5-TR stipulates that the onset of symptoms for a specific learning disorder must occur during the school-age years. Lastly, \"Exclusion of any other mental disorders\" is misleading, as the diagnosis of a specific learning disorder does not necessitate the complete exclusion of other mental disorders but requires that the academic difficulties are not better accounted for by another disorder or condition.",

      ],
      "answer": "Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts,\" is essential for a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as outlined in the DSM-5-TR. This criterion highlights the need for impairments in social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and relationship development that occur consistently across various settings, indicating a pervasive and significant impact on the individual's ability to engage socially.\n\n2. The option \"Symptoms must be present only in early childhood\" is incorrect because, while symptoms typically emerge in early development, they must persist and be evident in multiple contexts throughout the individual's life for a diagnosis of ASD. The statement \"Deficits must be solely related to language development\" is misleading, as ASD encompasses a broader range of social communication deficits beyond just language, including nonverbal cues and social interactions. Lastly, the option \"Presence of a medical condition that affects cognitive functioning\" is also incorrect; ASD can occur independently of other medical conditions affecting cognitive functioning, and the diagnosis focuses specifically on the core symptoms related to social communication and behavior patterns.",
