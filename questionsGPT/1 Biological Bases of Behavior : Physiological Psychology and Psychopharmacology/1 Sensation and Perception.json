      ],
      "answer": "Blue and yellow",
      "explanation": "1. \"Blue and yellow\" is the correct answer because, according to opponent-process theory, color vision is based on three pairs of opponent colors: red/green, blue/yellow, and white/black. This theory posits that the visual system processes these color pairs in opposing channels, meaning that the activation of one color in a pair inhibits the perception of the other color, making blue and yellow a valid opposing pair.\n\n2. The option \"Red and blue\" is incorrect because, while both colors are part of the color spectrum, they are not processed as opposites in the opponent-process theory; instead, red is paired with green. \"Green and orange\" is also incorrect since green is paired with red in the opponent-process model, and orange is not one of the defined opponent color pairs. Lastly, \"Purple and green\" is wrong because purple is not an opponent color of green in this theory; green is paired with red, while purple is typically associated with blue in terms of color processing.",

      "explanation": "1. \"Red-green color blindness\" is the correct answer because it is the most frequent type of color blindness and is primarily caused by a recessive gene located on the X chromosome. This genetic basis explains why it affects males more often than females; males have only one X chromosome, so inheriting a single mutated gene is sufficient for them to develop color blindness, while females require two copies of the mutated gene from both parents.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Blue-yellow color blindness**: This type of color blindness is caused by an autosomal dominant gene, which affects males and females equally, rather than being linked to the X chromosome.\n- **Total color blindness (achromatopsia)**: Achromatopsia is a different condition characterized by a complete inability to perceive color, which is not specifically linked to the X chromosome or more common in males.\n- **Monochromacy**: Monochromacy refers to a condition where an individual perceives no color at all, and it is not specifically associated with the X chromosome or gender differences in prevalence.",

      "explanation": "1. **Retinal disparity** is the correct answer because it specifically refers to the difference in the images perceived by each eye due to their slightly different positions. This binocular cue is essential for depth perception, as the brain integrates these two images to gauge the distance of objects, with greater disparity indicating closer proximity.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: \n   - **Linear perspective** is a monocular cue that relies on the convergence of parallel lines as they recede into the distance, helping to create the illusion of depth but not involving the integration of images from both eyes.\n   - **Texture gradients** are also a monocular cue that involves the gradual change in texture detail as objects recede into the background, relying on information from a single eye rather than both.\n   - **Motion parallax** is a monocular cue that describes how objects closer to the observer appear to move faster than those further away when the observer is in motion, again not requiring input from both eyes for depth perception.",

      "answer": "Non-painful stimuli close the spinal cord gate by activating large myelinated fibers, inhibiting pain signal transmission.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Non-painful stimuli close the spinal cord gate by activating large myelinated fibers, inhibiting pain signal transmission,\" aligns with gate control theory. This theory posits that the spinal cord contains a \"gate\" that can be opened or closed based on the type of incoming signals. When non-painful stimuli are present, they activate larger myelinated fibers, which can effectively close the gate to pain signals transmitted by smaller unmyelinated fibers, thereby reducing the perception of pain.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Non-painful stimuli deactivate nociceptors directly,\" is wrong because nociceptors are specifically responsible for detecting pain, and their deactivation is not the mechanism described in gate control theory. The second incorrect option, \"Non-painful stimuli reduce emotional response to pain via higher brain structures only,\" is incorrect because gate control theory focuses on spinal cord mechanisms rather than emotional processing in the brain. Lastly, the option \"Non-painful stimuli increase pain signal transmission for faster healing\" is incorrect because it contradicts the principle of gate control theory, which suggests that non-painful stimuli inhibit pain signal transmission rather than enhance it.",

      "answer": "Letters or numbers evoke specific colors automatically.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Letters or numbers evoke specific colors automatically,\" accurately describes grapheme-color synesthesia, a condition where an individual experiences a sensory cross-activation between visual stimuli (like letters and numbers) and color perception. In grapheme-color synesthesia, the perception of certain graphemes triggers an involuntary experience of color, illustrating the unique way in which sensory modalities can interact in this condition.\n\n2. The option \"Sounds trigger tactile sensations on the skin\" is incorrect because it describes a different type of synesthetic experience, not grapheme-color synesthesia, which specifically involves visual stimuli and color. \"Emotions produce automatic taste sensations\" is also incorrect as it refers to a sensory interaction involving taste and emotion, which is not related to the visual nature of grapheme-color synesthesia. Lastly, \"Visual stimuli cause olfactory experiences\" is incorrect because it suggests a combination of visual and olfactory senses, whereas grapheme-color synesthesia is specifically about the automatic association of colors with letters and numbers, not with smells.",

      "answer": "Weber's law",
      "explanation": "1. **Weber's Law** is the correct answer because it specifically predicts that the just noticeable difference (JND) for a stimulus is a constant proportion of the original stimulus intensity. For example, it states that to notice a change in weight, the second object must differ by a specific percentage (2%) from the first, regardless of the actual weight of the first object.\n\n2. **Fechner's Law** is incorrect because it describes a logarithmic relationship between psychological sensation and the magnitude of a physical stimulus, rather than focusing on a constant proportion for the JND. **Stevens's Power Law** is also incorrect as it proposes an exponential relationship between psychological sensation and physical stimulus magnitude, differing by stimulus type, rather than a constant proportion for JND. Lastly, **Signal Detection Theory** is not applicable here because it emphasizes the decision-making process in perceiving stimuli amidst background noise, rather than predicting the JND based on stimulus intensity.",

      "answer": "Stimulus absent but reported as present",
      "explanation": "In signal detection theory, a \"false alarm\" occurs when the perceiver incorrectly reports the presence of a stimulus that is not actually there. This means that the individual has mistakenly identified a signal amidst background noise, leading to a perception that something is present when it is not. This aligns with the definition provided in the reference material, which states that a false alarm happens when the stimulus is absent, but the person indicates it is present.\n\nNow, let's examine the incorrect options:\n\n1. **Stimulus present and correctly detected**: This option is incorrect because it describes a \"hit,\" where the stimulus is indeed present, and the perceiver accurately identifies it.\n\n2. **Stimulus present but not detected**: This option is wrong because it represents a \"miss,\" which occurs when the stimulus is present, but the individual fails to recognize or report it.\n\n3. **Stimulus absent and correctly reported as absent**: This option is incorrect as it describes a \"correct rejection,\" which happens when the stimulus is not present, and the individual correctly identifies that it is absent. \n\nIn summary, a false alarm specifically refers to the misidentification of a nonexistent stimulus, whereas the other options describe accurate or incorrect responses to an actual stimulus.",

This law is more accurate than both Weber’s and Fechner’s laws, as it accounts for the differences in how various stimuli affect sensory perception, determined through the method of magnitude estimation.\n\n2. **Fechner's law** is incorrect because it describes a logarithmic relationship between psychological sensation and physical stimulus magnitude, rather than an exponential one. **Weber's law** is also incorrect as it predicts that the just noticeable difference (JND) is a constant proportion of the original stimulus, which does not reflect the exponential relationship outlined in Stevens's power law.

      "answer": "Because red-green color blindness is linked to a recessive gene on the X chromosome, and males have only one X chromosome.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer states that \"red-green color blindness is linked to a recessive gene on the X chromosome, and males have only one X chromosome.\" This is accurate because red-green color blindness is primarily caused by a recessive gene located on the X chromosome. Males, having only one X chromosome inherited from their mothers, are more likely to express color blindness when they inherit the mutated gene, whereas females require the mutated gene to be present on both of their X chromosomes to exhibit the condition.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Because blue-yellow color blindness affects only females,\" is wrong because blue-yellow color blindness is caused by an autosomal dominant gene, affecting both males and females equally, not just females. The second incorrect option, \"Because red-green color blindness is caused by an autosomal dominant gene,\" is incorrect because red-green color blindness is specifically linked to a recessive gene on the X chromosome, not an autosomal dominant gene.

      "explanation": "1. \"Relative size\" is the correct answer because it is a monocular depth cue that allows us to judge the distance of an object by comparing its size to that of other objects in the visual field. When two objects are known to be of similar size, the one that appears smaller is perceived as being farther away, helping us to determine depth based on their relative sizes.\n\n2. **Retinal disparity** is incorrect because it is a binocular cue that relies on the slightly different views each eye has of an object, rather than a single eye's perspective. **Convergence** is also incorrect as it is a binocular cue that involves the inward turning of the eyes when focusing on a close object, which does not pertain to monocular depth perception. **Motion parallax** is incorrect because it involves the perception of depth based on the relative motion of objects as we move, which is distinct from the static comparison of sizes used in relative size.",

      "answer": "By separating the sensory processing from decision processes and incorporating response bias and sensitivity.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"By separating the sensory processing from decision processes and incorporating response bias and sensitivity,\" accurately reflects the principles of signal detection theory (SDT). SDT posits that perception is influenced by both sensory information and decision-making processes, which include the perceiver's sensitivity to stimuli and their decision criterion or bias. This separation allows for a more nuanced understanding of how individuals make judgments about stimuli in the presence of uncertainty and background noise.\n\n2. The option \"By assuming sensory input is always clear and reliable\" is incorrect because SDT explicitly acknowledges that perception occurs in the presence of uncertainty and noise, rather than assuming clarity. The statement \"By predicting a linear relationship between stimulus intensity and sensation\" is wrong as SDT does not rely on linear relationships; it recognizes that the relationship can vary based on individual differences in sensitivity and decision criteria. Lastly, the option \"By relying solely on the strength of the stimulus to determine perception\" is incorrect because SDT emphasizes that perception is not determined solely by stimulus strength but also by the decision-making processes influenced by factors like motivation, fatigue, and background noise.",

Retinal disparity occurs when the two eyes perceive slightly different images due to their horizontal separation, while convergence refers to the inward movement of the eyes when focusing on a nearby object. Together, these cues help the brain gauge the distance of objects that are relatively close.\n\n2. **Monocular cues** are incorrect because they depend on the input from only one eye and are used for depth perception of objects at greater distances, not for those that require binocular processing. \n\n**Kinesthetic cues** are also incorrect as they refer to the sense of body position and movement, which is not directly related to visual depth perception. \n\n**Pictorial cues** are wrong because they involve techniques used in two-dimensional images to create the illusion of depth, rather than relying on the physiological mechanisms of binocular vision.",

The correct answer, \"Distraction stimulates large myelinated fibers that close the spinal cord gate, reducing pain signal transmission,\" aligns with gate control theory, which posits that small unmyelinated fibers transmit pain signals while larger myelinated fibers can inhibit these signals.

The statement \"Top-down processing is irrelevant in recognizing shapes as it relies solely on sensory input\" is also wrong, as top-down processing specifically involves the use of prior knowledge, making it highly relevant in recognizing familiar shapes. Lastly, the claim \"Bottom-up processing is faster than top-down processing in all recognition tasks\" is misleading because the speed of recognition can vary based on the context and familiarity with the shapes; top-down processing can often be quicker when prior knowledge is applicable.",
