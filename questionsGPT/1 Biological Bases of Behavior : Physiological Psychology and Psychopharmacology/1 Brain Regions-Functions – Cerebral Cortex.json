      ],
      "answer": "Nonfluent, labored speech with relatively intact comprehension",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Nonfluent, labored speech with relatively intact comprehension,\" describes the clinical presentation associated with damage to Broca's area, which is located in the dominant (usually left) frontal lobe. Individuals with Broca's aphasia, also known as expressive aphasia, exhibit slow and effortful speech that primarily consists of nouns and verbs, while their ability to comprehend spoken and written language remains relatively unaffected.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Fluent speech with impaired comprehension and word substitutions,\" describes Wernicke’s aphasia, which results from damage to Wernicke’s area in the temporal lobe, not Broca's area. The second incorrect option, \"Loss of writing skills and right-left disorientation,\" relates to Gerstmann’s syndrome, which occurs due to damage to the dominant parietal lobe and is not associated with Broca's area. The third incorrect option, \"Complete inability to recognize faces of familiar individuals,\" refers to prosopagnosia, which is caused by bilateral lesions in the occipitotemporal junction and is unrelated to Broca's area and its functions.",

The **Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** is the correct answer because it is primarily responsible for most executive functions, including goal-directed behavior and working memory. Damage to the DLPFC can lead to impairments in these areas, resulting in deficits in judgment, insight, and overall executive functioning.\n\n2. The **Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)** is incorrect because it is more involved in decision-making, social cognition, and emotion regulation rather than specifically in goal-directed behavior and working memory. The **Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)** is also incorrect as it primarily plays a role in emotion regulation and social behaviors, not directly in executive functions or working memory. Lastly, the **Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)** is wrong because it is associated with decision-making and emotional self-control but does not encompass the broader executive functions and working memory deficits characteristic of DLPFC damage.",

Although individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia can produce grammatically correct sentences and maintain prosody, their speech lacks meaningful content, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- **Broca's area in the left frontal lobe**: Damage to Broca's area leads to Broca’s aphasia, which is marked by nonfluent speech, slow and labored production, and relatively intact comprehension, contradicting the fluent speech observed in the patient.\n\n- **Right parietal lobe**: Damage to the right parietal lobe typically results in contralateral neglect and sensory processing issues rather than the language deficits described in the patient’s presentation.\n\n- **Primary motor cortex in the left frontal lobe**: Damage to the primary motor cortex affects motor functions and movement initiation, not language comprehension or production, and would not result in the fluent speech and language impairments exhibited by the patient.",

These symptoms directly align with the description provided in the reference material, confirming Gerstmann’s syndrome as the appropriate choice.\n\n2. **Conduction aphasia** is incorrect because it results from damage to the arcuate fasciculus, which connects Wernicke’s area to Broca’s area, and is characterized by fluent speech with impaired repetition and comprehension, rather than the specific deficits seen in Gerstmann’s syndrome. **Limb-kinetic apraxia** is also incorrect as it involves an inability to make precise, coordinated movements due to damage to the dominant parietal lobe, but does not encompass the broader cognitive deficits associated with Gerstmann’s syndrome. Lastly, **contralateral neglect** is incorrect because it typically arises from damage to the right (nondominant) parietal lobe, leading to neglect of the left side of the body and stimuli, rather than the specific cognitive impairments seen in Gerstmann’s syndrome.",

      "answer": "Cortical blindness",
      "explanation": "1. \"Cortical blindness\" is the correct answer because it occurs when the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe is damaged while the eyes and optic nerves remain intact. This condition results in the inability to consciously see visual stimuli, despite having functional visual pathways, leading to a lack of awareness of visual information.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Prosopagnosia**: This condition is characterized by an inability to recognize familiar faces and is caused by bilateral lesions in the occipitotemporal junction, not damage to the primary visual cortex alone.\n- **Tactile agnosia**: This refers to the inability to recognize objects by touch and is associated with damage to the parietal lobe, specifically the somatosensory cortex, rather than the occipital lobe.\n- **Broca’s aphasia**: Also known as expressive aphasia, this disorder arises from damage to Broca’s area in the frontal lobe, affecting speech production and language expression, which is unrelated to visual processing in the occipital lobe.",

      "answer": "Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is the **orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)** because damage to this area is associated with impulsivity, social inappropriateness, lack of empathy, and emotional dysregulation. The OFC plays a crucial role in emotion regulation and social behaviors, and when it is impaired, individuals may exhibit behaviors such as immature conduct, inappropriate jocularity, and aggressive actions, all of which reflect difficulties in managing emotions and social interactions.\n\n2. The **ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)** is incorrect because it primarily contributes to decision-making and emotional self-control, and damage here leads to impairments in these areas rather than impulsivity or social inappropriateness. The **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)** is also incorrect; while it is involved in executive functions and goal-directed behavior, damage results in impaired judgment and apathy, not specifically impulsivity or emotional dysregulation. Finally, the **ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)** is not the correct answer because damage to this area affects decision-making and social cognition, leading to moral judgment impairments rather than the impulsivity and emotional dysregulation characteristic of OFC damage.",

      "answer": "Denial of illness and neglect of the left side of the body",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Denial of illness and neglect of the left side of the body,\" is associated with damage to the right parietal lobe, which can lead to *contralateral neglect* (neglect of the left side of the body) and *anosognosia* (denial of one’s illness). This is consistent with the reference material, which states that right parietal lobe damage typically results in neglect of stimuli on the left side.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n\n- **Inability to repeat phrases and impaired comprehension**: These symptoms are indicative of damage to Wernicke’s area or Broca’s area, which are located in the temporal and frontal lobes, respectively, rather than the parietal lobe.\n  \n- **Nonfluent speech and anomia**: These symptoms are characteristic of *Broca’s aphasia*, which arises from damage to Broca’s area in the left frontal lobe, not the right parietal lobe.\n\n- **Loss of color vision and visual hallucinations**: These symptoms are associated with damage to the occipital lobe, which processes visual information, rather than the parietal lobe.",

      "answer": "Essential for emotional prosody and understanding pragmatics",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Essential for emotional prosody and understanding pragmatics,\" accurately reflects the role of the right hemisphere in language because it is responsible for the expression of emotion through variations in speech (emotional prosody) and for the use and understanding of language in social contexts (pragmatics). While the left hemisphere is dominant for most language functions, including grammar and syntax, the right hemisphere contributes significantly to how language is used in social interactions and emotional expression.\n\n2. The option \"Dominant for producing grammatical and syntactic language\" is incorrect because grammatical and syntactic functions are primarily associated with the left hemisphere, which is dominant for language in most individuals. The statement \"Controls the majority of phoneme discrimination in adults learning their first language\" is also wrong, as the left hemisphere is primarily responsible for phoneme discrimination, particularly in language acquisition. Lastly, \"Primary region for logical and analytical language functions\" is incorrect because logical and analytical thinking is a function of the left hemisphere, which is where most language processing occurs, rather than the right hemisphere.",

      ],
      "answer": "Unable to verbally identify the spoon but able to pick it up with the left hand",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Unable to verbally identify the spoon but able to pick it up with the left hand,\" reflects the unique functioning of split-brain patients. When a picture of a spoon is presented to the left visual field, the visual information is processed by the right hemisphere, which does not have direct access to language capabilities. Consequently, the patient cannot verbally identify the spoon, but they can use their left hand (controlled by the right hemisphere) to pick it up.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Verbally declaring they see a spoon and picking it up with the right hand,\" is wrong because the left hemisphere, which controls verbal communication and the right hand, does not receive the visual information when it is presented to the left visual field. The second incorrect option, \"Inability to recognize or pick up the spoon with either hand,\" is incorrect because while the patient cannot verbally identify the spoon, they can still use their left hand to pick it up, as the right hemisphere can process the visual information. Lastly, the option \"Correctly identifying the spoon verbally and by touch with either hand\" is incorrect because the right hemisphere, which processes the visual information, lacks the language function necessary for verbal identification, thus making it impossible for the patient to verbally identify the spoon.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is \"Left dominant parietal lobe causing ideomotor apraxia\" because the left parietal lobe is responsible for the ability to plan and execute purposeful movements. Damage to this area can lead to ideomotor apraxia, which specifically impairs a person's ability to imitate motor activities or perform them in response to verbal commands, such as \"pretend to comb your hair.\"\n\n2. The \"Right temporal lobe\" is incorrect because it primarily processes auditory information and is not involved in the execution or imitation of motor activities. The \"Left occipital lobe\" is wrong as it is responsible for processing visual information, and damage here would not affect motor imitation. Lastly, the \"Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\" is incorrect because, while it contributes to executive functions and decision-making, it does not specifically relate to the ability to imitate motor actions as the parietal lobe does.",

      "answer": "The right hemisphere controls most functions of the left side of the body and vice versa",
      "explanation": "1. The statement \"The right hemisphere controls most functions of the left side of the body and vice versa\" is correct because, as noted in the reference material, for most sensory and motor functions, the right hemisphere is responsible for controlling the left side of the body, while the left hemisphere controls the right side. This contralateral organization is a fundamental aspect of brain lateralization and functional specialization.\n\n2. The option \"The left hemisphere controls the left side of the body; the right hemisphere controls the right side\" is incorrect because it misrepresents the contralateral control principle; each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body. The statement \"Both hemispheres equally control sensory and motor functions on both body sides\" is wrong because it fails to acknowledge the distinct lateralization, where one hemisphere is primarily responsible for each side. Lastly, \"The left hemisphere controls sensory functions; the right hemisphere controls motor functions\" is incorrect as both hemispheres are involved in both sensory and motor functions but have specific lateralized roles; the left hemisphere is generally dominant for language and analytical tasks, while the right hemisphere excels in holistic and spatial tasks.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Impaired moral judgment, reduced empathy, blunted emotional responses, and confabulation,\" is associated with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). According to the reference material, the VMPFC is involved in decision-making, social cognition, memory, and emotion regulation; damage to this area can lead to deficits in moral judgment, a lack of empathy, blunted emotional responses, and confabulation, which is the fabrication of memories without the intention to deceive.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Nonfluent aphasia, impaired repetition, and word substitutions,\" is wrong because these symptoms are characteristic of damage to Broca’s area, not the VMPFC. The second incorrect option, \"Severe memory loss, inability to form new memories, and spatial disorientation,\" is incorrect as these symptoms are more typical of damage to the hippocampus or related structures involved in memory, rather than the VMPFC.
