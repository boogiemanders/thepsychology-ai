      ],
      "answer": "Internal locus of control and internal locus of responsibility (IC-IR)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, **Internal locus of control and internal locus of responsibility (IC-IR)**, is characteristic of mainstream American culture because individuals with this worldview believe they are in control of their own outcomes and are responsible for their successes and failures. This perspective aligns with the American emphasis on individualism, personal agency, and self-determination, as proposed by Sue (2006).\n\n2. The option **Internal locus of control and external locus of responsibility (IC-ER)** is incorrect because it describes individuals who believe they can control their outcomes but attribute the responsibility for their failures to external factors, which does not reflect the mainstream American cultural emphasis on personal accountability. **External locus of control and external locus of responsibility (EC-ER)** is incorrect as it refers to individuals who believe they have little control over their outcomes and do not see themselves as responsible for them, contrasting sharply with the values of self-efficacy prevalent in American culture. Lastly, **External locus of control and internal locus of responsibility (EC-IR)** is also incorrect because it describes individuals who feel they lack control over outcomes but still take responsibility for their failures, which is not representative of the mainstream American belief in personal control and responsibility.",

      "explanation": "1. **Integration** is the correct answer because it involves retaining one's own minority culture while also adopting the majority culture. According to Berry (2005), individuals who adopt an integration strategy experience the least acculturative stress, as they can maintain their cultural identity while benefiting from the resources and support of the majority culture.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n   - **Assimilation**: This strategy involves rejecting one’s own minority culture in favor of fully adopting the majority culture, which can lead to a loss of cultural identity and increased stress.\n   - **Separation**: This strategy entails retaining one’s own minority culture while rejecting the majority culture, which can result in social isolation and difficulties in adapting to the broader society, leading to higher acculturative stress.\n   - **Marginalization**: This strategy involves rejecting both one’s own minority culture and the majority culture, often resulting in the highest levels of acculturative stress due to a lack of support and connection to any cultural group.",

      "answer": "Assuming a minority group member is a foreigner and complimenting their English skills.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Assuming a minority group member is a foreigner and complimenting their English skills,\" exemplifies a microinvalidation because it negates the individual's identity and experiences by implying they do not belong or are not from the country, despite their fluency. Sue et al. (2007) define microinvalidations as communications that exclude or nullify the psychological reality of a person of color, and this statement fits that definition by dismissing the minority individual's status as a member of the local culture.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"An explicit derogatory name-calling based on race,\" describes a microassault, which is characterized by intentional and overt derogation rather than a subtle invalidation. The second incorrect option, \"Assigning intelligence level based on a person’s race,\" is a form of microinsult, as it devalues an individual based on racial stereotypes but does not specifically negate their experiences or identity. Lastly, \"Demeaning nonverbal communication styles of people of color\" also represents a microinsult, as it involves insensitivity to cultural communication styles rather than the exclusion of the individual's reality, which is the hallmark of microinvalidations.",

      "answer": "White privilege includes unearned benefits that Whites often take for granted and are largely unaware of.",
      "explanation": "1. The correct statement, \"White privilege includes unearned benefits that Whites often take for granted and are largely unaware of,\" accurately reflects McIntosh's (1998) definition of white privilege. McIntosh emphasizes that these benefits are conferred based solely on skin color and often go unrecognized by White individuals, who may not be aware of the privileges they enjoy in various aspects of life, such as shopping without harassment or seeing their race widely represented in media.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"White privilege solely benefits Whites economically and politically,\" is wrong because white privilege encompasses both macro-level systemic advantages and micro-level interpersonal benefits, affecting various aspects of daily life beyond just economic and political realms. The second incorrect option, \"White privilege is generally recognized and acknowledged by most White individuals,\" is inaccurate as McIntosh notes that most White people remain unaware of their race-related privileges due to denial. Lastly, the option \"White privilege refers exclusively to interpersonal experiences, not systemic advantages,\" is incorrect because white privilege is described by McIntosh as having both systemic and interpersonal components, indicating that it operates at both levels rather than being confined to personal interactions.",

      "answer": "Emic perspective",
      "explanation": "1. The \"Emic perspective\" is the correct answer because it emphasizes that behavior is influenced by culture, suggesting that psychological theories and interventions may not be universally applicable across different cultural groups. This perspective recognizes the unique cultural contexts that shape individuals' experiences and responses, making it essential to tailor psychological practices to fit specific cultural backgrounds.\n\n2. The \"Etic perspective\" is incorrect because it posits that psychological theories and interventions are similar across cultures, implying a one-size-fits-all approach rather than acknowledging cultural specificity. The \"Universalist perspective\" is also incorrect as it suggests that certain psychological principles are universally applicable regardless of cultural context, which contradicts the emic viewpoint. Lastly, the \"Relativistic perspective\" is not the correct answer because, while it acknowledges cultural differences, it does not specifically focus on the application of psychological theories and interventions as being culture-specific, as the emic perspective does.",

      "answer": "Higher conformity to social norms and preference for stability",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Higher conformity to social norms and preference for stability,\" reflects Gelfand's findings that individuals in tight cultures exhibit stronger adherence to social norms and lower tolerance for deviant behaviors. These cultures often develop strict social norms as a response to ecological and human-made challenges, necessitating conformity to maintain order and stability within the society.\n\n2. The option \"Lower conscientiousness and higher openness to experience\" is incorrect because Gelfand's research indicates that individuals in tight cultures tend to have higher levels of conscientiousness and lower levels of openness to experience, contrasting with loose cultures. The statement \"Higher tolerance for deviant behavior and risk-taking\" is also wrong, as tight cultures are characterized by low tolerance for deviant behaviors, not higher. The option \"Greater willingness to innovate and challenge social norms\" is incorrect because individuals in tight cultures are less likely to innovate or challenge established norms, in contrast to those in loose cultures who are more open to such behaviors.",

      "answer": "Maintaining a formal style and understanding that silence and limited eye contact express respect",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Maintaining a formal style and understanding that silence and limited eye contact express respect,\" aligns with the cultural values of Asian American clients. Research indicates that Asian Americans often prefer a formal therapeutic approach, as well as nonverbal communication styles where silence and limited eye contact are seen as expressions of respect and politeness. This understanding fosters a more effective therapeutic relationship by demonstrating cultural sensitivity.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Encouraging open emotional expression and direct eye contact early in therapy,\" is wrong because it contradicts the cultural tendency of Asian Americans to value restraint and nonverbal cues over overt emotional expression and direct eye contact, which may be perceived as confrontational. \n\nThe second incorrect option, \"Using a casual interpersonal style and minimizing formality throughout therapy,\" is inappropriate as it overlooks the preference for a formal and respectful interaction style that Asian American clients typically expect in therapy settings.\n\nThe third incorrect option, \"Minimizing family involvement to focus on the individual client,\" fails to recognize the importance of family and community in Asian American culture, where collective well-being often takes precedence over individual concerns; thus, family involvement is crucial in the therapeutic process.",

      "answer": "Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II)",
      "explanation": "1. The **Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (KABC-II)** is the correct answer because it is specifically designed to reduce cultural bias in cognitive testing and is less influenced by English proficiency. This assessment allows for a more accurate evaluation of cognitive abilities in culturally diverse children by focusing on nonverbal skills and minimizing language dependence.\n\n2. The **Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V)** is incorrect because it relies heavily on verbal skills and may disadvantage children with limited English proficiency, leading to biased results. The **Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales** is also incorrect as it similarly emphasizes verbal abilities, which can be influenced by cultural and language factors, potentially skewing the assessment outcomes. Lastly, the **Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)** is inappropriate in this context as it is primarily a personality assessment tool, not designed for cognitive testing, and does not address cultural bias in cognitive abilities.",

      ],
      "answer": "Fearing rejection by family or peers",
      "explanation": "1. \"Fearing rejection by family or peers\" is the correct answer because it represents a proximal stress process, which, according to minority stress theory, occurs within the individual and includes internalized fears and anxieties related to their sexual orientation. This fear directly affects the individual's mental health and well-being, as it stems from their personal experiences and perceptions of potential rejection from close social circles.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect because they represent distal stress processes, which are external to the individual. \"Experiencing verbal harassment due to sexual orientation\" involves external acts of discrimination that arise from societal prejudice. \"Suffering physical assault related to stigmatization\" also refers to external violence and discrimination that individuals face in their environment.

      "answer": "Diagnostic overshadowing",
      "explanation": "1. **Diagnostic overshadowing** is the correct answer because it refers to the tendency of mental health professionals to attribute all problems of clients with a specific diagnosis, such as a gay client’s issues being solely linked to their sexual orientation, while overlooking other potential causes. This phenomenon can lead to an incomplete understanding of the client’s presenting problems and may hinder effective treatment, as it fails to consider the broader context of the client’s experiences and challenges.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n   - **Confirmation bias** refers to the tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s pre-existing beliefs, not specifically about attributing all problems to one factor.\n   - **Own-race bias** (ORB) is the tendency to more accurately perceive and identify faces of individuals of one's own race compared to others, which does not relate to the misattribution of causes for a client’s problems.\n   - **Cultural encapsulation** describes the inability of mental health professionals to work effectively across cultures due to insensitivity to cultural differences, but it does not specifically address the misattribution of problems based on a single characteristic like sexual orientation.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Greater accuracy in perceiving and identifying faces of one's own race compared to other races,\" accurately describes the phenomenon known as own-race bias (ORB). Research indicates that individuals are more adept at recognizing and recalling faces of their own racial group due to increased exposure and familiarity, which enhances their ability to perceive subtle differences among those faces (Anthony et al., 1992). This bias has significant implications, particularly in contexts such as eyewitness testimony, where misidentifications are more likely to occur with individuals of different races (Meissner et al., 2005).\n\n2. The option \"Difficulty recalling faces of individuals of any race after a delay\" is incorrect because it does not specifically address the comparative accuracy related to own-race bias; rather, it suggests a general memory issue that applies universally. The statement \"Tendency to confuse faces of one’s own age group more than other age groups\" is wrong because it conflates age-related recognition with race-related recognition, which are distinct biases. Lastly, \"Higher false alarm rates when identifying same-race faces over other-race faces\" is inaccurate because it contradicts the findings of ORB, which actually shows higher false alarm rates for cross-race identifications, not same-race faces.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Higher-status immigrants report more discrimination and less positive identification with the mainstream society,\" reflects the integration paradox as explained by Meyer (2003) and others. Higher-status immigrants, who are more educated and economically successful, often have greater access to mainstream society, which increases their likelihood of encountering discrimination. This exposure leads to a heightened awareness of their marginalized status, resulting in a decreased positive identification with mainstream society.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Lower-status immigrants report more discrimination and less identification with the mainstream society,\" is wrong because it overlooks the fact that higher-status immigrants, not lower-status ones, experience greater discrimination due to their increased interactions with the mainstream. The second incorrect option, \"Higher-status immigrants report less discrimination and more positive identification with the mainstream society,\" contradicts the integration paradox, which emphasizes that higher-status immigrants actually face more discrimination.

      ],
      "answer": "Internal locus of control and external locus of responsibility (IC-ER)",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer is **internal locus of control and external locus of responsibility (IC-ER)** because individuals with this worldview believe they have the ability to control their outcomes but attribute their failures to external factors or others preventing them from achieving success. This reflects a mindset where personal agency is recognized, yet the individual does not accept personal accountability for setbacks, viewing them as a result of external circumstances.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n   - **External locus of control and internal locus of responsibility (EC-IR):** This worldview suggests that individuals feel they have little control over their outcomes but still take personal responsibility for their failures, which contradicts the question's premise.\n   - **External locus of control and external locus of responsibility (EC-ER):** Individuals with this worldview believe they have no control over their outcomes and also do not feel responsible for them, which does not align with the idea of having control over outcomes.\n   - **Internal locus of control and internal locus of responsibility (IC-IR):** This worldview indicates that individuals believe they are in control of their outcomes and also take full responsibility for their successes and failures, which is contrary to the specified belief in the question.",
