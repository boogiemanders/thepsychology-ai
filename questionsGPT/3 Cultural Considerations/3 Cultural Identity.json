        "Commitment to social activism to reduce oppression"
      ],
      "answer": "Questioning previous views due to events that raise awareness of racism’s impact",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Questioning previous views due to events that raise awareness of racism’s impact,\" accurately describes the Encounter stage in Cross’s original Nigrescence Model. In this stage, individuals begin to critically examine their beliefs about both White and Black cultures as a result of experiences that highlight the effects of racism in their lives. This questioning marks a pivotal shift from idealization of White culture to a growing awareness and interest in their own Black culture.\n\n2. The option \"Idealizing Black culture while rejecting White culture\" is incorrect because this description aligns with the Immersion-Emersion stage, where individuals fully embrace their own culture and reject the dominant culture. The statement \"Negative attitudes toward Black culture and preference for White culture\" is wrong as it characterizes the Pre-Encounter stage, where individuals have internalized negative views about their own culture and idealize White culture. Lastly, \"Commitment to social activism to reduce oppression\" is incorrect because this reflects the Internalization-Commitment stage, where individuals have fully accepted their Black identity and are actively engaged in social activism, not during the Encounter stage.",

      "explanation": "1. \"Racial centrality\" is the correct answer because it refers to the extent to which a person defines themselves in terms of their race relative to other identities, such as gender or religion. This dimension captures how important race is in shaping an individual's overall self-concept and identity.\n\n2. \n- **Racial salience** is incorrect because it pertains to the relevance of race at a specific point in time or situation, rather than its overall importance in the person's identity compared to other identities.\n- **Racial regard** is incorrect as it focuses on an individual's feelings about African Americans (private regard) and how they believe others view African Americans (public regard), rather than the importance of race in their self-definition.\n- **Racial ideology** is incorrect because it refers to a person's beliefs and opinions about how African Americans should interact with society, which does not address the personal significance of race in their overall self-concept.",

      "answer": "Pseudo-Independence",
      "explanation": "1. \"Pseudo-Independence\" is the correct answer because it is characterized by individuals who are beginning to question their beliefs about race but often display superficial tolerance toward minority groups. This status may include paternalistic attitudes and behaviors that, despite appearing supportive, actually perpetuate racism rather than challenge it, indicating a lack of genuine understanding or commitment to anti-racist principles.\n\n2. \n- **Immersion-Emersion:** This status involves individuals searching for a personal meaning of racism and understanding their White identity, characterized by a deeper engagement with issues of race rather than superficial tolerance.\n- **Reintegration:** In this status, individuals typically hold beliefs of White superiority and blame minority groups for their problems, reflecting a rejection of the complexities of racial dynamics rather than a superficial acceptance.\n- **Disintegration:** This status is marked by confusion and anxiety stemming from moral dilemmas regarding race, leading to ambivalence rather than the superficial tolerance seen in Pseudo-Independence.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Suspecting one is gay or lesbian leading to anxiety and use of denial or avoidance,\" accurately reflects the Identity Confusion stage in Troiden’s Model of Homosexual Identity Development. This stage occurs during middle or late adolescence when individuals begin to feel sexual attraction to the same sex, leading to uncertainty and anxiety. To cope with these feelings, individuals may employ strategies such as denial or avoidance, as they grapple with their emerging identity.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Feeling different from same-sex peers during childhood,\" describes the Sensitization stage, where individuals recognize their differences from peers but have not yet developed sexual attraction or identity awareness. The second incorrect option, \"Beginning to accept a gay or lesbian identity and seeking related social relationships,\" pertains to the Identity Assumption stage, where individuals start to embrace their sexual orientation and actively seek connections within the LGBTQ+ community. Lastly, the option \"Internalizing the identity and being comfortable disclosing sexual orientation to others\" refers to the Identity Commitment stage, where individuals have fully accepted their gay or lesbian identity and are open about it with others, contrasting with the uncertainty and anxiety characteristic of the Identity Confusion stage.",

According to Sellers et al., individuals with a nationalist ideology believe that African Americans should control their own destinies, reflecting a strong connection to their cultural identity and a desire for autonomy.\n\n2. The incorrect options are as follows:\n- **Assimilationist:** This ideology emphasizes the similarities between African Americans and the broader American society, advocating for integration and working within the existing system to effect change, rather than focusing on unique African American experiences.\n- **Humanist:** The humanist ideology prioritizes the commonalities among all humans and downplays the significance of race, advocating for broader issues like peace and poverty rather than specifically addressing the unique needs of the African American community.\n- **Oppressed minority:** This ideology highlights the shared experiences of oppression between African Americans and other minority groups, promoting coalition-building rather than a focus on African American self-determination and independence.",

      "explanation": "1. \"Active exploration\" is the correct answer because it is specifically defined in Worthington et al.'s model as the status involving purposeful exploration, evaluation, or experimentation of one’s sexual needs, values, orientation, and preferences. This stage emphasizes the active engagement in understanding one's sexual identity, distinguishing it from other statuses that do not involve such proactive inquiry.\n\n2. \n- **Unexplored commitment** is incorrect because it reflects a sexual identity that is shaped by societal and familial mandates without any active self-exploration or personal evaluation of one's sexual orientation.\n- **Diffusion** is wrong as it is characterized by a lack of active exploration and commitment, indicating confusion about identity rather than purposeful exploration of sexual values or preferences.\n- **Synthesis** is not the correct answer because it pertains to the integration of one’s sexual identity with other identities, rather than the active exploration of sexual orientation or preferences.",

      ],
      "answer": "Preference for a therapist from the majority group",
      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Preference for a therapist from the majority group,\" reflects the attitudes of individuals in the Conformity stage of Atkinson, Morten, and Sue’s R/CID Model. In this stage, individuals typically hold positive attitudes toward members of the majority group and negative or neutral attitudes toward their own minority group. They often accept negative stereotypes of their own group and view the majority group's values as superior, leading them to prefer a therapist from that group.\n\n2. The option \"Preference for a therapist from their own minority group\" is incorrect because individuals in the Conformity stage tend to reject their own cultural identity and prefer the majority group, not their own. \n\nThe option \"No preference and openness to any therapist\" is not accurate, as individuals in this stage are likely to have a clear preference for a majority group therapist due to their acceptance of majority values. \n\nLastly, the option \"Preference for a therapist unfamiliar with cultural issues\" is incorrect because individuals in the Conformity stage generally prefer therapists who align with the majority culture, reflecting their lack of appreciation for their own culture, rather than seeking someone unfamiliar with cultural dynamics.",

      "explanation": "1. The correct answer, \"Private regard refers to a person's own feelings toward African Americans; public regard refers to perceived others’ views,\" accurately captures the distinction made by Sellers et al. in their Multidimensional Model of Racial Identity. Private regard pertains to an individual's internal feelings about their racial group, while public regard reflects how they believe society views that group, highlighting the difference between personal self-perception and social perception.\n\n2. The first incorrect option, \"Private regard refers to others' views of the racial group; public regard reflects personal feelings toward the group,\" is wrong because it reverses the definitions of private and public regard, misrepresenting their meanings. The second option, \"Private regard and public regard are identical constructs measuring positive feelings about race,\" is incorrect because it fails to recognize that private and public regard are distinct constructs measuring different aspects of racial identity. The third option, \"Private regard deals with political beliefs; public regard deals with cultural practices,\" is incorrect as it inaccurately attributes political and cultural dimensions to private and public regard, which are specifically about personal and societal perceptions of racial identity.",

Individuals in this status typically have limited interactions with racial minorities, leading to an obliviousness regarding the complexities of race relations.\n\n2. **Why Each Incorrect Option is Wrong:**\n   - **Reintegration:** This status involves an attempt to resolve moral dilemmas about race by believing in the superiority of Whites over minority groups, which is contrary to the denial of racism seen in \"Contact.\"\n   - **Disintegration:** In this status, individuals become aware of race-related contradictions and experience confusion and anxiety, indicating a recognition of racism rather than denial.\n   - **Autonomy:** This status reflects a developed nonracist White identity and an appreciation for diversity, which is a significant departure from the denial of racism present in the \"Contact\" status.",

At this stage, they are comfortable disclosing their sexual orientation to others, including heterosexual individuals, and have accepted homosexuality as a valid and integral part of their lives.\n\n2. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- **Sensitization** is the initial stage during childhood characterized by feelings of difference from same-sex peers, but it does not involve acceptance or disclosure of sexual orientation.\n  \n- **Identity Confusion** occurs in middle or late adolescence when individuals begin to feel attraction to the same sex and experience uncertainty and anxiety about their sexual identity, but they have not yet reached a point of acceptance.\n\n- **Identity Assumption** is the stage where individuals begin to accept a gay or lesbian identity and seek social relationships within the LGBTQ+ community, but they may not yet be fully comfortable disclosing their orientation to heterosexual individuals.",

The \"Assimilationist ideology\" is incorrect because it focuses on the belief that African Americans should work within the existing societal structures to change them, rather than emphasizing coalition building with other minority groups. The \"Humanist ideology\" is also incorrect; it prioritizes the similarities among all humans and downplays racial identity, which does not align with the focus on shared oppression among minorities.
